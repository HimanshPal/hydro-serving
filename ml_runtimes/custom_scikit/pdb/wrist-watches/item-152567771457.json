  "Description": "WELCOME TO MY AUCTION I have a nice ladies dress watch by Charter Club. It is new without the tags and retails for $35. The body of the watch is gold tone metal with a stainless steel case back and Japaneses quartz movement. The round bezel of the watch is fixed and set with a row of pave accent crystals. The dial is brushed silver with white hands ,gold tone numeral and pave crystal hour markers. The bracelet of the watch is gold tone metal with a ivory colored insert and fold over stainless steel double button clasp. The watch is running and keeps good time, but I do not guarantee how long the battery will last due to self life. Please view my pictures for more details.
