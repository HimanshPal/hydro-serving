  "Description": "You are looking at a rare black Tag Heuer Alter Ego WP131A women's watch. This watch does not disappoint. The black dial is stunning. I own over 225 tag heuer watches (and I currently have quite a few for sale). It was simply time to clean out the closet. I am a TAG Heuer collector. The crystal is in mint condition with no scratches. The back casing is very good with some fine scratches. The bracelet is stainless steel and it is in very good condition with typical light wear scratches. I would rate this TAG as a 9.1 out of 10 in condition. It is beautiful. It keeps perfect time. It is quartz movement and 100 meters water resistant. It was sized at the jeweler and it will currently fit a size 6.75 inch wrist or smaller. In fact, if you need extra links I would be willing to sell you some at $20 per link or $15 each for two or more. I have access to them from a local jewelry store. If you want the extra links just let me know immediately after purchase so I can invoice you for them. This watch was selling for $1500 new and I am giving you a great discount. This is 100% authentic. Why pay $1500 for a brand new tag when you can buy this new one for much less? Please see my other tag heuers for sale too!!!! I will insure watch for priority mail shipping. SHIPPING IS FREE WITH BUY IT NOW. The Tag leather display is not included in the auction. Watch comes with a TAG Heuer leather case & pillow. The case is in great condition.

I AM CLEARING OUT MY HUGE COLLECTION. LOOK AT MY FEEDBACK. IT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF! I AM ONLY SELLING MINT CONDITION ITEMS. DO NOT TRUST THESE OTHER EBAYERS SELLING USED AND BEAT UP WATCHES. All items come from my smoke free and pet free home. Trust me as i have a 100% positive feedback rating!!!! My feedback speaks for itself! INVTW11#2628 Shipping is FREE to the USA. Shipping is $45 to most international destinations including Canada and the UK. However there are a few countries in which shipping will be higher. Australia, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries will cost more. Contact me BEFORE PURCHASING IF FROM AN INTERNATIONAL COUNTRY SO I CAN VERIFY SHIPPING COSTS. I have had some issues with UK buyers being able to purchase because of an ebay glitch. If you are from the UK and have issues please contact me and I will change some settings so that you can purchase. Thanks",
