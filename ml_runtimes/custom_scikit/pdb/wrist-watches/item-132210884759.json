  "Description": "This band was obtained from a former HP employee at the Corvallis, OR HP plant that made the original HP-01 watch. In among the parts and pieces was this very rare, prototype band. Based on my research, I cannot find a SMOOTH BLACK Leather band as an optional accessory. Perhaps it is made up, but it has the EXACT SAME dimensions as an Original Brown Alligator Band. Therefore, my best guess is this was a prototype band to test fit. See Pictures. Please use the pictures as your final determination on condition and not solely rely on my language. I do my best to describe the items I sell as accurately as possible. If you want an additional picture, please ask and I will be happy to add it.
