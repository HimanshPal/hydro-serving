  "Description": "chapelle_jewellery Visit our eBay Shop Add us to your Favourites list > Subscribe to our Newsletter > About Chapelle Delivery The Chapelle Guarantee Mens Henley large dial gunmetal casing H02108.13 RRP \u00a329.99 Now \u00a319.99 Description A sporty yet comfortable fitting silicone strap ensures the perfect fit for any wrist with this men\u2019s Henley watch. The silicone strap is light grey in tone and is topped with a gunmetal coloured buckle clasp that ensures a secure fitting. The white metal gun metal coloured casing compliments the grey strap and makes this watch ideal for every occasion. The dial is protected by a tough mineral glass that is curved to protect from different pressures. Circulating the carbon fibre-like textured dial are ultra-white hour markers. Each hour is marked by a baton, except for the number twelve. Following on from each hour is a minute track, also with white batons to mark each minute that passes. This Henley designer watch also features a chronograph look with a three dial design on the dial; matching buttons on the side of the casing complete the chronograph look. The iconic Henley logo is situated in the middle of the dial just below the number 12. The dial is approximately 51mm in width and approximately 10mm in depth. The Henley H02108.13 are supplied in official Henley boxes and supplied with a 1 year manufacturer\u2019s guarantee.
