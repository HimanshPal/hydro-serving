  "Description": "EXCELLENT VINTAGE LADIES BULOVA SUPER SEVILLE WRISTWATCH. This watch is in excellent running order. There are a few of these listed with wear to the plate etc. This is not one of them. The only problem is the small length of the bracelet as shown in the pictures., so I am selling this with a good quality black genuine leather strap, or maybe you have the spare links required. This is a good Bulova in excellent running order. I will fit the leather strap prior to posting if required. Thank you for your interest, please take a look at my other items. The pictures provided are considered a major part of the description as vintage watches can have age related marks/blemishes, so please take time to study them carefully as all sales are final. Please also feel free to ask any relevant questions and I will gladly answer them honestly. UK postage for items over \u00a350 is now special delivery for insurance purposes. International postage will be charged at the actual rate plus \u00a35 packaging. I always advise servicing unless I state otherwise in the listing. If a watch/clock is advertised as working it is at the time of posting. Returns are not accepted unless the item has been grossly misrepresented, this never happens. I cannot and will not be held responsible for items damaged or lost in the post. Fast payment always ensures fast dispatch of items. As with all vintage watches/clocks, no claims are made regarding accuracy of time keeping. Vintage watches may need servicing, even if they are in good running condition, and unless otherwise stated they may need to be cleaned, timed, oiled or adjusted. All watches are sold as is, no returns.",
