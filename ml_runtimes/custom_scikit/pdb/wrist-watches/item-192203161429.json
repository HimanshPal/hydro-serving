  "Description": "Brand description: G - SHOCK (G - shock) which built up a new concept of toughness on the clock. Everything began with a reckless challenge that overturned the common sense at the time, a developer's faith belief that it would make a timepiece that would not break even if dropped. Over 200 prototypes were repeated, about two years have been spent, completed, the impact resistant structure. It is the birth of technology that is the core of tough. Since then, G - SHOCK has continued evolution without end. Structure, material, function. Pursue further toughness from every aspect. Master of G \"Gulf Master\" assumed to be used at sea, which is one of the most harsh natural environments on the earth, will be equipped with four sensors that are the first of G - SHOCK and will appear with great evolution. The coast guards (Coast Guard) etc. have assumed functions of rescue operations and security guards on rough sea, and have the function to grasp the changing situation of the ocean every moment. As an analog model of G - SHOCK, we have installed a water depth sensor for the first time, an atmospheric pressure sensor to predict rapid weather change, a temperature sensor to read change of temperature / water temperature, a direction sensor for checking the direction of the wind direction and the tide Was installed. The azimuth meter detects the inclination of the clock, has an automatic horizontal correction function that can measure by correcting its inclination, and has evolved to be able to respond to use on ship which sway greatly. Also, information such as sudden change in barometric pressure and tide graph showing low tide / high tide are indicated by 5 o'clock side in dial. With retrograde display by dual coil motor, various information can be easily checked. It is possible to grasp the situation of the ocean in real time in a scene fighting on time in a changing natural environment. In pursuit of further toughness, newly adopted carbon fiber reinforced resin case excellent in rigidity. The durable metal pipe and triple O ring are interiorly arranged in the button part to improve waterproofness. In addition, we adopted soft urethane for the buffer cover and band on the back, realizing high mountability. In order to challenge the limits of the sea, Gulf Master has come to fruition the inevitable functional evolution. \u25cf Impact Structure\u25cf Tough Solar (Solar Charging System)\u25cf 20 ATM water resistant function\u25cf Radio reception function: \u00b7 Automatic reception (up to 6 times / day) (China radio is up to 5 times / day) / manual reception) \u00b7 Corresponding area: Japan \u00b7 North America region \u00b7 Europe region \u00b7 China * Can receive home time setting When set as a city, you will receive stations that match the city.

As atmospheric pressure changes due to natural phenomena, the altitude of the measured value also changes. SHIPPINGFree shipping!
