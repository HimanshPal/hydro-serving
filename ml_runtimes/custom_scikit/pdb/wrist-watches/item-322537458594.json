  "Description": "Titanium SEIKO 5M42-0A20 KineticSEIKO Stock Ref: SKH004P1A Discontinued Model and highly sought after! 1 x Left in Stock!This is one of the lightest, most comfortable watches SEIKO ever made!All titanium 5M42 Kinetic, unbelievably light on the wrist.... SEIKO Box and Papers included. Dial: Grey dial with Gold accents. Case: Solid Titanium case! Dimensions: width 38mm excluding crown, 40mm including crown. Bracelet: Solid titanium bracelet... Full size no links removed, superb quality here! Movement: 5M42 kinetic quartz movement fitted with a new Seiko lithium-ion ESU (Seiko's Electricity Storage Unit, 2017 stock) that allows the watch to run up for up to 4 months on a full charge compared to only 7-14 days with its original capacitor! The Automatic Power Generator in the movement generates electrical energy to power the watch, utilizing the movement of the arm while wearing the watch, and stores it in the ESU. The current power reserve of the ESU is indicated by the second hand at the press of a button. When the energy stored in the ESU is reduced to a very low level, the second hand starts moving in two-second intervals to indicate that the ESU needs recharging by swinging the watch from side to side. This Kinetic quartz movement keeps excellent time and does not require winding or battery replacement unlike many watches on the market. Payment: I accept: Paypal or direct bank transfer...
