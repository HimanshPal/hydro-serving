  "Description": "chapelle_jewellery Visit our eBay Shop Add us to your Favourites list > Subscribe to our Newsletter > About Chapelle Delivery The Chapelle Guarantee Men\u2019s Dreyfuss & Co. 1953 two-tone chronograph watch DGB00063/06 RRP \u00a3650.00 Now \u00a3375.00 Description Bright tones of yellow gold contrasting against deep black give this men\u2019s Swiss-made Dreyfuss & Co. 1953 family chronograph watch elegance and depth. With its two-tone stainless steel silver and yellow gold plated design, the fine detailing decorating this practical chronograph watch make this suitable for any occasion. The silver-cream round dial is marked around the edges with gold tone batons, indicating the hours. A slim minute and second track in white surrounds the batons against a thin rim of black. Three sub dials are positioned on the centre of the dial, each with a black inner, displaying timing functions. Two are surrounded with an edging of gold tone, and each are marked with clear white numbering and notches. A date window is positioned at four o\u2019clock. The watch hands themselves are gold tone, positioned to clearly catch the light upon the dial and to provide informative timekeeping. Sapphire crystal glass protects the dial. Surrounding the watch dial is a fixed yellow-gold plated bezel, framing the rich detailing upon the face and corresponding with the two chronograph control buttons, either side of the yellow-gold plated crown. The yellow-gold plating also blends in seamlessly with the bracelet strap design, running down the centre of the links, providing a contrast against the matte stainless steel. The watch casing measures approximately 39mm in width and 12.5mm in depth. This watch has been handmade to meet Dreyfuss & Co.\u2019s Seafarer Standard, assuring you it is totally waterproof and impervious to water damage.
