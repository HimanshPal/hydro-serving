  "Description": "Welcome to my listing for a Jules Jurgensen ladies wristwatch. Jules Jurgensen is an established brand of quality timepieces. This watch presents with sophistication and features two Garnets, each approximately 5mm in width. These two gems are larger than what one usually finds on quality watches. The face constantly shimmers beautifully with Mother of Pearl pastel shades. Three extensions for the mesh-style gold wristband are included. Please note that as this is an Estate watch, there are areas showing some wear (the gold finish). However, the watch is still striking and eye-catching. The Crown has been pulled to save remaining battery life for the new owner. Any questions, please ask. Sold as is, without original box. Sale is final. Thank you for looking. **International buyers are responsible for any possible customs taxes, duty, or border related costs.**",
