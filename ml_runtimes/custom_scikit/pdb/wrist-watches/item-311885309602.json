  "Description": "Here is a great vintage Bradley Mickey Mouse watch with the original band. It works but stops frequently. Needs cleaning and servicing. Decent used vintage condition. What you see is what you get. Check out our other listings for more watches. Payment is due within 24 hours of invoice. We retain the right to relist or resell unpaid items that are not paid for within 24 hours. Shipping Policy: Most of our smaller items are shipped flat rate USPS Priority Mail since Priority Mail is the least expensive shipping option with insurance on your item. If you would prefer an item be shipped first class, we can adjust the invoice but shipping first class voids are return policy. So no returns on first class shipping. We cannot take responsibility if the shipper damages the item. Large items are generally priced for shipping from our location to the furthest continental US destination. Buyers who are closer to us feel free to request a shipping quote. We provide very fast shipping and will combine shipping when possible. Return Policy: We will accept returns within 14 days of the item being shown received on tracking (except first class packages). The buyer pays the return shipping under ALL circumstances. (Exceptions will be made if the wrong item is shipped). Payment is due within 24 hours of invoice, unless we are contacted and make other arrangements. We are happy to ship anywhere in the US or internationally. For US shipping price is as listed, for international shipping, we will adjust the invoice and make the cost as reasonable as possible if possible. Most international shipping is through the eBay International Shipping Program and we do not control the pricing. Good ratings are greatly appreciated if you can. Please also contact us with any problems before leaving negative or neutral feedback. We are always open to working out any issues that might arise. We are cool people. You should be too. All good business is greatly appreciated!",
