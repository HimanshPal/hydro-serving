We are a family run Jewellers in South London that specialises in fine watches and diamond jewellery. We offer some of the finest brands on the market at very competitive prices. Our ability to offer fantastic customer service is of great importance to us. Our goal is not to make a sale but to create a rapport with our customers so that they feel happy to purchase from us regularly and recommend their friends. This is our main goal and is something that our company strives for. We have over 30 years\u2032 experience and are extremely passionate about what we do and the fantastic service we provide. We realise that the demand for quality jewellery and watches online is vast so we have decided to launch our own website. However, competition is also vast and so when choosing to purchase online you must be certain of who you are buying from. There are many online sellers who do not have a physical shop. I have found from my experience that customers much prefer the fact that they can come down to our store and view their desired item, try it on and make their purchase. I feel that this has been paramount to our recent success with our online business as there is no anxiety of waiting for a package to arrive worth thousands of pounds. It is very important that before you decide to purchase anything online you do your research and make sure that all of your questions are fully answered. Below we have some more information about our company. Thank you for visiting our site. PAYMENT We accept Paypal, Bank transfer, Cash up on collection and Credit/Debit card (Chip and Pin, face to face only) SHIPPING All our watches and Jewellery are appropriately packaged and are fully insured to make sure that they do not get damaged in transit. We have never had any incidents with a customer receiving a damaged item as every precaution is taken to ensure that your watch arrives to you safely. All UK purchases are sent using Royal Mail Special delivery which guarantees to have your item with you by 1pm signed for and fully insured. CONTACT US Whether you have a product related question; need some help choosing a gift or have a query concerning an existing order, we're here to help!
