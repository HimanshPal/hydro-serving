In 1854 Tiffany & Co., New York, becomes an official customer of Patek Philippe & Co, in the United States of America. Patek Philippe and Tiffany & Co. share a special relationship that is unmatched in retailing in the United States. The partnership began with a handshake agreement in 1851 between the companies' founders Antoine Norbert de Patek and Charles Lewis Tiffany. That agreement, based on shared principles of trust and integrity, fostered a relationship that continues to promote the highest standards of excellence. The two companies have much in common. Established only two years apart -- Tiffany in 1837 and Patek Philippe in 1839 -- both were founded on an uncompromising commitment to craftsmanship. PAYMENT: I accept PAYPAL.
