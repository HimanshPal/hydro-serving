  "Description": "This is a set of inner and outer vintage Rolex boxes. I have had these boxes for many years and the stain on the outer box has always been there. The outer box is still in \"good\" shape meaning that all of the corners are intact and not torn. The inner box is in very good condition as for as the outer condition is concerned and the inner box does show slight wear on the velvet bottom and on the inside of the lid. I would estimate these are from the late 1960's to the early to mid 1970's and are in good condition considering their age. To the best of my knowledge this box would have been used for the 5513 and 1680 Submariner, GMT Master, Explorer and possibly the Thunderbird or Daytona. Please feel free to ask any questions. Please add $10 for Hawaii or Alaska shipping. I also use the Global Shipping program, however due to previous problems I DO NOT SHIP TO THE FOLLOWING COUNTRIES, Malaysia, Italy, Russian Federation. Thank you!",
