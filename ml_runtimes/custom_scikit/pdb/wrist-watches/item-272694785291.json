Today, the finest pilot watches incorporate movements like the Unitas 6497 or 6498 in order to commemorate those times of the past. That is why Balmer sought out and obtained the last remaining Unitas 6431 movements with \u201cIncabloc\u201d\u2122 shock protection. To the best of our knowledge, only 400 of these movements exist in unassembled Ebauches kits in all of Europe. The Unitas 6431 is the 18-1/2 \u201dLigne big brother to the 16-1/2\u201d Ligne 6497, and was the most popular movement actually worn by many of the pilots of WWII. Out of production for over 35 years, the 400 Unitas 6431 movements that make up this very limited series were originally destined for the pilots of World War II. We have confirmed that these movements have been stored in a climate-controlled facility as unassembled \u201cEbauches\u201d kits since before 1968. This New Old Stock has been meticulously assembled and tested by some of the finest watchmakers in Switzerland. Each watch is numbered and will be delivered with a certificate of Authenticity in an oversized wooden box. This is truly a very limited edition of a one of a kind Pilot's Watch that bears historical significance. Only one of Balmer\u2019s many efforts to deliver something truly magnificent to the discerning collector. DON'T WANT TO SELL IT BUT HAVE TO, TO PAY FOR MY CANCER TREATMENTS...",
