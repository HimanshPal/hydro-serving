  "Description": "ABSOLUTELY MINT, VIRTUALLY 'NEW'! if you're looking at this post, then you already know about this particular model, so i won't go into lengthy details. you can find great reviews online on some credible 3rd party sites (PM if u want reference to those sites). i am the original owner since 2011, purchased from authorized dealer. triple box - outer, inner and wood boxes all papers, including original warranty card stamped by AD 3 straps - original textile strap, OEM black alligator strap, and OEM rubber strap - even though the textile strap is what originally comes with the Palermo, i think the rubber strap matches best with the vulcanized rubber exterior of the case and carriage. original brushed SS double deployant here's the best detail of this watch: it just came back from full service at JLC - so you'll have full year warranty until Mar 2018 (see invoice photo). moreover, the carriage is a BRAND NEW replacement (long story, i nicked a very small rubber part of the underside of the lug, which was not noticeable when wearing; and frankly if it wasn't for the fact that i'm OCD, it really didn't need to be replaced - however, during the service JLC replaced it for free!). i tried to take some good/clear photos to show how fresh and new everything looks, especially the details of the carriage - see the shots of the inner tracks where the case's ball bearing glide, and how new and unblemished it is. and the perlage on the top flat of the carriage - the photos don't do this justice, it's absolutely gorgeous especially when struck with light. flipping the case feels absolutely brand new and firm...not 'loose' as it would feel over time, which those who own reversos know what i'm speaking of. with recent factory service and brand new carriage from JLC, this watch is virtually BRAND NEW! you won't be disappointed. going a different direction, recently obsessed with AP RO, and need to make room (and funds!). regular member of and listed on TZ, TRF and WUS - message me and i will provide my handle so that u can look me up as verification.",
