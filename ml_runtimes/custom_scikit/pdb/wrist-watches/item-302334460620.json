  "Description": "This Glycine Incursore wristwatch is in excellent mechanical condition and features light wear on the case and bracelet. It would make a fine addition to any collection. The 46mm stainless steel case and 22mm wide (from lugs to clasp) bracelet feature a brushed finish. Highly legible black dial features minutes, hours and small seconds at the 9 o'clock position. Arabic 12, 3, 6, hour indices, small seconds hand and dial are all illuminated (see photo). Sapphire crystal front and back. The focal point of this watch is its movement, the Swiss made work horse ETA 6897. All original links are included in the bracelet. Also included is the original 22mm Glycine black leather strap with white stitching and stainless steel tang buckle. This watch is stunning on both the bracelet and the black leather strap. I am the original owner. Watch was purchased May, 2012 and has not ever been serviced. That being said, I have never had a problem with it. Winding is smooth and sturdy. Crown clicks in and out of place firmly. Hands set smoothly with virtually no play (if you're like me, you get aggravated when you click the crown back into place only to see the minute hand move by a degree or two). When not being worn, the watch was tucked safely and snugly in a padded watch box. It has never been placed down on its crown and, although it is rated to 200M, it has never been worn in or even near water. Original box and papers included. Buyer pays shipping. Item will ship within two business days of payment via USPS Priority Mail with insurance and required signature to any location in the United States. Good luck and thanks for looking!",
