  "Description": "This is an auction for a totally original gents Sekonda \"De Luxe\" with what looks just like a gloss explorer dial, which is all original, the watch is in very good condition with the only real flaw being a chip to the dial finish at 3 oclock that will need touching in gloss black, I wouldn't suggest a new dial because its superb apart from that.Great overall quality and the first Sekonda I can honestly say I would be happy to wear, I am not a fan but after having a good look at this one I can see why people do like them. Sold now as a good restoration project only that is working well but needs a small dial touch up and has been a box for years, has not been tested by us and all I can say is its winding smoothly and working strongly. Sold now as is for restoration / clean up. Size: Approx 34 mm across without the winder. Any questions please ask.All no reserve auctions we list run all the way so please do not ask for buy now prices as we came to ebay as buyers which I still do on occasion and the thing I dislike most is when items I am watching get sold off ebay and auctions stopped, it seems wrong so now that we are clearing out and selling some items we play by the rules and over the last few years we have turned down some good offers only for those people to buy the item in the end very cheaply, they usually then buy again but at the very least know we are some of the good guys...........",
