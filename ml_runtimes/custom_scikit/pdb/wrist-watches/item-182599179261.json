  "Description": "Up for sale is a rare Poljot stainless steel automatic from the late 70s to early 80s. This watch was an expensive commodity in the former USSR mostly made for the export market, hence the English text. It was checked by a watchmaker a few months ago, and is currently (at the time of this listing) running at +10 to 15 seconds a day. Date function works, and can be set manually. The case, hands and dial exhibits wear, but is still in good condition for a 40 year watch. All parts are 100% Soviet original, with the exception of the crystal. For the past few months it was stored in a shelf at room temperature, and was never exposed to dirt or moisture during that time. Since this is a vintage timepiece, usage in rough conditions, while swimming, while exercising is not recommended. This is a very uncommon and interesting piece of horological history to add to your collection, so don't miss out! I will throw in a one-piece black NATO strap for free International shipping: $12 (Standard airmail)*Due to government restrictions I will not ship to these countries:BelarusBurmaCentral African RepublicC\u00f4te d'IvoireDemocratic Republic of the CongoEritreaIranIraqLebanonLiberiaLibyaNorth KoreaSomaliaSouth SudanSudanSyriaTunisiaYemenZimbabwe Please look closely at the pictures as what you see is what you will get. I do not offer any warranty and hope for no claim, no return. If you have any questions, please ask! Thank you for looking!",
