  "Description": "You are looking at a very rare white faced Tag Heuer WK1220.BB0315 women's or men's 2000 classic sport watch. This model is rarely offered for sale. Model WK1220.BB0315 is considered the Tag midsize watch and can be worn by either a man or a woman. This watch is a true survivor. I am a Tag Heuer collector and I own over 225 Tag Heuer watches. I currently have quite a few for sale. It was simply time to clean out the closet. It is the mid size tag watch with a case diameter of about 35mm....39mm including the crown. The midsize was typically worn by a man back in the 80s and 90s but I feel that it is more suited for a woman nowadays, based on its size. It is really all about your preference so please look at the size. I would say it is more suited for a smaller man or a man who likes smaller faced watches....or a lady who likes bigger than normal ladies sized watches. The crystal is in mint condition. The back casing is in very good condition with light wear scratches. The bracelet is stainless steel with gold plating and is in good condition with typical wear scratches. The clasp and surrounding area looks good, with some light scratching or desk rash. The bezel is very good with gold color and light scratching. Some of the gold plating is starting to wear off some of the link edges. I would rate this true survivor as a solid 8.75 out of 10 in condition. The white face is stunning on this watch. New battery just installed and serviced by Tag Heuer dealer. The stainless band is all original and will fit a 7.2 inch or smaller size wrist. In fact, if you need extra links I would be willing to sell you some at $25 per link or $20 each for two or more. I have access to them from a local jewelry store. If you want the extra links just let me know immediately after purchase so I can invoice you for them. It also has the rare wet-suit extender which allows someone with a larger wrist to wear it. Bezel turns nice and crisply in counter clockwise direction, as it should. It has always kept perfect time. It is quartz movement and 200 meters water resistant. It does not come with the Tag display model that the watch is featured on. This is quite simply one of the nicest used Tags on the market. It used to retail for $1595. I would recommend having seals tested before wearing in water as a precaution. Keeps perfect time. Please see all of my other Tag Heuers for sale too. I have men's and women's tags that are new and used and in all price ranges. I will insure watch for priority mail shipping. SHIPPING IS FREE. The Tag leather pedestal display is not included. No box. Remember that others sell their watches as new, mint, etc. Educate yourself! My feedback speaks for itself! I have sold 1000s of Tags and I only sell top shelf Tags that have been well cared for.WK1220.BB0315 TAG HEUER CLASSIC 2000 MIDSIZE WATCH - WITH MANUFACTURER SERIAL NUMBERS - White Dial - Date Feature - Battery Operated Quartz Movement - Guaranteed Authentic - Scratch Resistant Sapphire Crystal - Brushed & Polished Stainless Steel Case & Bracelet - 200 Meters / 660 Feet Water Resistant - 35mm = 1 1/2\" Case, 7.2\" Adjustable Bracelet - Deployment Buckle - Luminescent Hands & Markers - Screw Down Crown & Case back ALL ITEMS COME FROM MY SMOKE FREE AND PET FREE HOME.
