  "Description": "You are looking at a NEW black faced Tag Heuer Formula One WAC1110.BA0850 Men's watch. This model does not disappoint. Model WAC1110.BA0850. I own over 225 Tag Heuer watches (and I currently have quite a few for sale). It was simply time to clean out the closet. I am a TAG Heuer collector. It is the full size tag watch with a face diameter of about 40mm (45mm including the crown). The crystal is in mint condition. Perfect crystal with no scratches. The back casing is perfect with no scratches. The clear protective sticker, serial number sticker, & inspector number are all still attached on the back casing! The bracelet is stainless steel and it is in mint condition. I would rate this TAG as a perfect 10 out of 10 in condition. It is beautiful. The blue clear protective stickers are still attached from the Tag factory on the entire clasp. Bezel turns nice and crisply in counter clockwise direction as it should. It keeps perfect time. It is quartz movement and 200 meters water resistant. The rubber bumpers are in perfect condition. It will currently fit a size 8 inch wrist or smaller. This watch is selling for $1500 new. The serial numbers are engraved on the back of the watch! This is 100% authentic. Why pay $1500 for a brand new tag when you can buy this one for much less? Please see my other tag heuers for sale too!!!! I will insure watch for priority mail shipping. SHIPPING IS FREE WITH BUY IT NOW. The white leather display unit is not included. It also comes with the Tag Heuer box(with model & serial number stickers attached), Tag Heuer case & pillow, TAG hang tag, TAG brochure, TAG warranty card, and Tag Heuer manual. All accessories are in excellent condition. The case is a bit sticky though, which is normal for the older cases. The box lid has a small tear.
