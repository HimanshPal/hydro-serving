Bulova insist that you always buy your watch from an authorised agent like here at Watches2U. Unauthorised stockists are likely to be trading in replicas and fake ladies and mens Bulova watches or grey imports, secondhand or faulty Bulova watches that don't come with an official Bulova warranty. Manufacturer InformationBulova was founded and incorporated as the J. Bulova Company in 1875 by Joseph Bulova (18511936), an immigrant from Bohemia. It was reincorporated under the name Bulova Watch Company in 1923, and became part of the Loews Corporation in 1979. Bulova have since then been designing quality watches and recently introduced a brand new range of more modern watches. The new range of Bulova watches combine classic old style fused with a more modern twist. These new Bulova watches continue with the companies reputation for cutting edge technology and design and the new range of both stylish and contemporary Bulova watches are constructed from quality materials which include stainless steel, leather and sometimes even diamonds and are available in classic watch colours such as black, white and gold which make the perfect watch for those looking for a quality and fashionable timepiece.
