  "Description": "PLEASE CLICK HERE TO SEE FULL ITEM DESCRIPTION Description Series: Seamaster Jacques Mayol 1998 Limited Edition Model #: 2586.70 Gender: Ladies / Womens Case/Band: Stainless steel Dial: Green (super rare dial color) Crystal: Sapphire Case size: 26MM Total circumference: 6.5\" (this is a pretty good size, but if you need larger please e-mail me for price/availability of additional links) Overall condition: Looks brand new. Sapphire crystal is flawless. Dial/hands are perfect. Bezel shines like new. Crown screws down perfectly. Bracelet shows no wear, has the original brushed/polished finishes, etc. You would have to look to the inside surfaces (the unseen parts like the inside of the band, caseback, etc.) to find any evidence of use whatsoever (and even then you won't see much). All top/outside surfaces look new. All functions have been tested and work perfectly. \u00a0This is limited edition # 1924 of 2500 made. \u00a0 Click here to view the WRISTWATCHTRADER EBAY STORE \u00a0 Sizing: Occasionally good fortune will shine upon us and the timepiece will fit perfectly upon arrival. \u00a0However, for the majority of cases we will need to add/remove links for desired fit. \u00a0For more info about how to obtain expansion links, please do not hesitate to contact me and I'll be happy to help.
