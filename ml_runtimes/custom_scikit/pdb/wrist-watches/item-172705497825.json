  "Description": "Untitled Document RARE! 1965 BULOVA 'Ambassador' MICRO-ROTOR AUTOMATIC DATE SWISS WATCH MEN I am pleased to offer this top class, all original, rare and sought after BULOVA wrist watch for men in slim and elegant design thanks to the micro-rotor amazing design of the movement as developed by BUREN in the 60s. This is a version with date, one of a kind, not to be missed. Movement: State of the art BULOVA Swiss micro-rotor automatic wind movement. This is a fine and desireable 12EBAD caliber, running well on 17 jewels. The movement is working well and clean, keeping good time. Date changes properly around midnight. This is a non quickset model. Case, Crystal & Crown: Original and signed BULOVA slim and elegant all quality stainless steel case in great shape, with mint crystal and good crown. Dial & Hands : 100% ORIGINAL FACTORY made dial in very good condition, very light aging with unique tapestry texture and raised markers. With original set of hands. Tip for collectors: Despite popular demand for refinished clean dials, I am aware of collectors' search and sensitivity for original dials. Therefore any dials known to be refinished, will be clearly mentioned in the dial section of the description. Otherwise, dial is believed to be 100% original. Size: Measures 35 mm side to side (excluding crown) and 41 mm lug to lug. Vintage watches are often smaller than watches common nowadays; To avoid inconvenience, Please take a moment to examine the size and make sure it meets your expectations and wrist size. Band: Equipped with a brand new genuine leather band in Ostrich tan brown, 18mm wide. The band/bracelet shown in the images is the exact one that will come with your watch. However please remember I sell the watch, not the band. Therefore, Please consider it as a gift for your watch, it is not considered as part of the description. Please keep in mind that due to the nature of these mechanical watches and their early age, although I fully stand behind my description, I can't guarantee perfect time accuracy. Photos are considered a part of the description. Shipping and handling - Worldwide flat rate: DHL Express door-to-door - 35.00 $US Expected delivery in 3 business days. Tracking available online. This is a signed for and fully insured express service. Once payment is made, I will send a confirmation email with expected date of shipping. I ship in 48 hours from clearance of funds, or earlier.
