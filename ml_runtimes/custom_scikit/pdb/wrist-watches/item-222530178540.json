With bold styling and sparkling design, the Bulova Diamond Collection features individually handset Diamonds for non-stop brilliance.

Featuring Bulova\u2019s proprietary Precisionist accuracy, this advanced chronograph offers 1/1,000-second precision over a twelve-hour time frame, with accuracy to within seconds a year. In stainless steel with curved crystal, multiple-layer black carbon fiber, blue, silver and black dial, chronograph measurement of hours, minutes, seconds, 1/10-seconds, 1/100-seconds and 1/1,000-seconds, yellow continuously sweeping second hand, luminous hour and minute hands, luminous markers, tachymeter, calendar, screw-back case, screw-down crown, double-press fold-over clasp with safety lock, and water resistance to 300 meters.Providing an extraordinary level of timing accuracy, the Bulova Precisionist Chronograph is the only chronograph to combine stopwatch timing to 1/1,000-second with Bulova\u2019s exclusive Precisionist-class torsional resonator movement, proven in laboratory testing to be one of the world\u2019s most accurate.Easy and logical to read, each style features four subdials to display the cumulative time at a single glance, with individual measurements on the combined 1/10- and 1/100-second counter, as well as the hour and minute dials, dual-duty floating second hand, and a distinctive 1/1,000-second track with retrograde indicator.Precisionist TechnologyAt the heart of the watch is the Bulova Precisionist-class torsional resonator movement, custom-engineered to provide accuracy to within seconds a year using a three-prong quartz crystal that creates a vibration frequency of 262.144 kHz, the highest of any watch in the world and far greater than that of a standard quartz crystal. In laboratory testing, the Precisionist-class movement has been shown to be three times more accurate than standard quartz. This proprietary manufactured movement, including the signature floating second hand, also offers a resistance to gravitational error that makes it superior in performance to any mechanical watch on the market.Summary of FeaturesPrecision timing to 1/1,000th of a second12-hour chronograph functionOne of the world\u2019s most accurate movements \u2013 accurate to within seconds a yearPrecisionist-class torsional resonator movement proven in laboratory testing to be three times more accurate than standard quartzStainless steel case and braceletCurved mineral crystalMultiple-layer black carbon fiber, blue and silver dialYellow continuously sweeping second handLuminous hour and minute handsLuminous markersCalendar windowTachymeterScrew-backScrew-down crownWater resistant to 300 metersBulova diamonds collectionStainless steel with 30 diamondsQuartz MovementCase Diameter: 26mmWater resistant to 30m (100ft): in general, withstands splashes or brief immersion in water, but not suitable for swimming or bathing",
