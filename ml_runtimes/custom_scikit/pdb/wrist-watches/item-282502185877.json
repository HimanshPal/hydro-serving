  "Description": "chapelle_jewellery Visit our eBay Shop Add us to your Favourites list > Subscribe to our Newsletter > About Chapelle Delivery The Chapelle Guarantee Ladies Rotary two-tone bracelet strap watch LB02572/01L RRP \u00a3159.00 Now \u00a399.00 Description The highly polished silver and rose gold tones of this bracelet strap ladies Rotary watch create an elegant and glamorous appearance. The round dial has a chunky rose gold coloured bezel that draws all the attention to the face. The dial has a white background and the rose gold coloured markers and hands stand out allowing the time to be read easily. The Rotary logo features on the dial just below the 12 o\u2019clock position. Measuring approximately 32mm in width, including the winder, the watch casing also has a depth of approximately 8mm. A push button clasp securely fastens the strap in place and links can be professionally removed to ensure the most comfortable fit. The watch strap and casing are both made of stainless steel and the dial has a mineral glass face, which is toughened and scratch resistant. Rotary watches come with a lifetime guarantee which is valid so long as the watch is serviced by the manufacturer every three years; this covers the internal workings of the watch such as the mechanism. Each watch is provided in its official original branded Rotary packaging. Chapelle reference 08131107.
