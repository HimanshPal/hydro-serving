We have over ten thousand items in stock with over 100 different brand names. We also sell watches and jewelry at over 10 trade shows per year across the country. All of our products sold are guaranteed authentic. We have sold hundreds of thousands of watches on our internet sites and through our network of wholesalers and customer satisfaction remains our number one priority. We are registered with the Jewelers Board of Trade and an accredited Better Business Bureau (BBB) member. Please visit our showroom when you are in the Phoenix area. Inventory Adjusters 3437 East McDowell Rd Phoenix, Arizona 85008 Telephone: 602-278-5966 FAX: 602-252-4598 Our hours of Operation are: Monday through Friday 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM SE HABLA ESPA\u00d1OL FAQFAQ Are Your Items Authentic? Yes. Everything we sell is authentic. Weve been in business for almost 34 years, and have dealt with many of the brands of watches made in that time. We are registered with the Better Business Bureau and the Jewelers Board of Trade. We inspect every item for authenticity and operation and guarantee the authenticity. With well over 100,000 watches sold online and countless watches sold at trade shows across the country, you can feel secure in the knowledge you are buying exactly what we advertise. How can you sell the watches at such low prices? We purchase our watches from closeouts, bankruptcies, and overstocks in very large quantities. We also save on the cost of our product by not paying a premium price for box and papers. Do your timepieces come with the original packaging and paperwork? We are not affiliated with any timepiece manufacturer's, so we can not offer the manufacturers warranty or paperwork. Unless the description states that it will come in a watch or jewelry box, the item will be shipped with no box. We provide printed instructions with most timepieces. What is your return policy? We have done our best to accurately describe this item. If you are uncertain, please ask questions before purchasing this item. We will do our best to reply promptly, answer questions honestly, and to the best of our ability. Contact us directly through ebay messages or by phone at 602-278-5966. For our online clients (US only): We offer a 30-day return policy on all jewelry and timepieces. If you are dissatisfied with your purchase for any reason within 30 days of purchase, Inventory Adjusters offers an exchange, a refund less a 10% restock fee, replacement, or full refund if the timepiece proves mechanically defective. Inventory Adjusters will determine the appropriate action upon receipt of the item. In order to be considered for a full refund, our tags must not have been removed from the item. For all returns, all links, boxes, and manuals must be included with the return. For our international, showroom, and trade show clients: All sales are final. Our warranty still applies, though. Why would you charge a restock fee? Because we offer our watches at such a deep discount and we provide free shipping, the restock fee mitigates our costs and allows us to continue to offer timepieces at a great discount. What about a warranty? We provide a two-year warranty through Inventory Adjusters, Inc. Our warranty is modeled after most manufacturers warranties and covers the operation of the timepiece itself. If the operation of the timepiece proves to be defective during the warranty period, we will repair or replace the item, at our option. Our warranty does not cover wear and tear, batteries, crystals, bands, straps, loss, or theft. If the case of the timepiece is opened by any party other than Inventory Adjusters, without our express consent, the warranty will be declared void. If you exceed the water resistance ratings (see below), that will also void our warranty. If I have a problem with my watch how do I get it repaired under your warranty? A copy of our warranty is shipped with every order. You must follow the instructions printed on the back of your receipt. What if it's not covered under warranty? Contact us anyway. In most cases, we can repair the issue at low cost to you or possibly find an equitable solution. What is the difference between a water-resistant watch and a waterproof watch? No timepiece is considered waterproof. Most timepieces are marked with a water resistance rating, whether on the dial or on the back of the case. Below is a chart based on a survey of manufacturer's express limitations of water resistance. Exceeding these limitations will void the warranty on your timepiece. Inventory Adjusters, Inc. strongly recommends against wearing any timepiece in a hot shower, bath, hot tub, or sauna as the temperature change may adversely affect the seals and moisture may be introduced into the case as a result. Note: If your timepiece does not have a marked rating, it is NOT considered water resistant and exposure to moisture should be avoided. ATM/Bar Meters Feet Limitations of specified water resistance 1 10 33 Protected against accidental exposure to water (splashes, washing hands) Note: Applies to timepieces marked \"Water Resistant\". 3 30 100 Suitable for everyday use (splashes, rain, washing hands). NOT suitable for swimming, showering, or otherwise submerging. 5 50 165 Suitable for everyday use (splashes, rain, washing hands). NOT suitable for swimming, showering, or otherwise submerging. 10 100 330 Suitable for recreational swimming and snorkeling. 20 200 660 Suitable for recreational diving. 30 300 990 Suitable for professional diving. Why can't I go swimming with a timepiece marked at 30 meters/100 feet? Water resistance is measured by the pressure a timepiece is designed to withstand. If you were to stay perfectly still, your 30M water resistant timepiece may survive submersion. Realistically, people will move in the water, and that movement increases the pressure on the seals of the timepiece. Hidden Deployment Clasp A hidden deployment clasp is the type where the clasp is invisible when it is being worn. The ends of the bracelet come together to meet so that none of the clasp shows. This is done to help the appearance. Closed Clasp Clasp Partially Open Clasp Fully Open Button Release Type Make sure the clasp is opened on both sides. If the clasp is not fully open the watch will probably not fit over the hand.
