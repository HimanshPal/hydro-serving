These functions are cleverly set out on a stylish silver dial that is enclosed in a fluted bezel. The articulately calibrated dial uses elegant luminescent hour and minute hands, a central needle-like seconds hand and Roman numeral hour markers to display local time in hours, minutes and seconds. For the GMT time zone display, an off-centered dial displays hours in 24-hour notation while minutes are displayed using a red rectangular indicator behind each Roman numeral hour marker. The dial also showcases a magnified rectangular date display at 3 o'clock and, as per modern Rolex tradition, the horologist's logo below 12 o'clock. The watch features a comfortable and durable brown crocodile leather and a round 42mm case made of 18K yellow gold.Please note that some watches are on memo from other dealers and do not carry a return policy, you will be notified before your purchase if the selected watch meets this criteria.
