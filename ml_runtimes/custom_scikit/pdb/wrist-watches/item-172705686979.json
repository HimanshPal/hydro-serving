  "Description": "Universal Geneve three register chronograph calendar watch manufactured c1995. Universal Geneve is a high class niche watchmaker, relatively unknown (and some would say a well-kept secret), producing the highest standards of quality for discerning buyers. Their watches are popular among serious and knowledgeable collectors who appreciate the fine quality and craftsmanship that goes into these watches. This watch is in excellent overall condition, having clearly been well cared for and probably infrequently used over the last twenty two years. The stainless steel case and dial present very well indeed and the movement is running strongly and keeping time with the chronograph and date functions operating correctly. This watch houses the Valjoux 7750 movement, considered by aficionados to be the best ever chronograph movements manufactured in recent years and used in several other high end watches, including Breitling, Tag Heuer, Longines, IWC and Omega. I have been collecting vintage watches for over twenty five years and selling them as an enjoyable lifestyle occupation since 2003. I have consistently received excellent feedback and many repeat buyers. Customer satisfaction is very important to me so if you do have any problems please get in touch. I will always do my best to help. I often assist customers several years after they have purchased a watch from me; so once you have bought a watch, you will remain an important customer. You can email me at jackanpet123@gmail.com to ask any questions. Please scroll down to see more photographs and details. Case: stainless steel, in very good condition, measuring approximately 40 mm across, excluding the crown and 46 mm from lug to lug. The outside of the screw back cover is signed Universal Geneve. The case shows the inevitable light marks from use over the years but absolutely no signs of abuse, dents or scratches of any significance that I could see to point out to you. Dial: original factory black satin finish, presenting very well, signed \"Universal Geneve Automatic Compax Swiss Made \" and bearing the Universal Geneve emblem. Hours are marked by applied gold coloured batons. The dial has three registers, the one at 12 o'clock displaying a 30 minute counter, the second at 6 o'clock showing a 12 hour counter, both of which operate when the chronograph function is activated. The third register located at 9 o'clock displaying a continuous seconds counter. The sweep hand shows seconds elapsed when the chronograph function is activated. The hands are in good shape and the crystal is clean and clear. Movement: signed \"Universal Geneve\" cal. UG98 (Valjoux 7750) Swiss automatic movement with 25 jewels, a ball-bearing rotor, unidirectional winding, 28.800 A/h, and a power reserve of 44 hours. The crown screws out from the case. The first position enables manual winding of the watch. Puling the crown out one notch activates the quick set calendar function and pulling it out a second notch enables the time to be set. The chronograph (stop watch) function is activated by pressing the button at the side of the watch located at 2 o'clock. Pressing the button again stops the function. The button at four o'clock resets the two chronograph registers and sweep hand to zero. Strap: fitted with a good quality generic black leather strap which attached to the watch measures approximately 216 mm from buckle tip to last hole. Overseas buyers should bear in mind that import duties, taxes and charges are not included in the item price or P&P charges. These charges are the buyer\u2019s responsibility. You are advised to check with your country\u2019s customs office to determine what these additional costs will be prior to bidding. If you have any questions do please contact me; my email address is jackanpet123@gmail.com Universal Geneve Watch Company The Universal Geneve Watch Company was founded in Le Locle, Switzerland, in 1894. Like many of the high quality Swiss watch companies, some of their finest timepieces were produced by Universal during the 1930's through to the 1950's, the heyday of the mechanical watch. Although the craftsmen who produced these watches used machine tooling, it was operated manually and the movements were assembled by hand. Therefore the craftsmanship of Universal Geneve vintage watches is superb. In addition, unlike a number of its competitors, Universal did not buy in \"ebauches\" (a complete \"raw movement\" without the escapement, balance, hairspring, mainspring, dial and hands) but made every part of their movements in-house. For this reason the company had total control over its production and has achieved a well deserved reputation for being placed among the highest quality watchmakers in the world. However like so many watchmakers, this all changed in later years so today Universal Geneve uses high grade ETA (Swatch Group) movements in their chronograph range.

Terms of Sale You are looking at a used watch which will show signs of wear. Please read carefully the detailed listing and study the photographs for a comprehensive description of the watch. If you have any questions please email me before purchase and I will do my best to help. I pack my watches very well to avoid damage but very occasionally a problem may occur due to rough treatment in transit or the use of scanning equipment by Customs or the postal services which can magnetise the watch mechanism. I warrant that the watch you purchase will, when you receive it, be as described in the listing. If there is a problem when you receive your purchase I provide a no quibble full refund option. Alternatively I will undertake any repairs that are necessary if the watch is damaged or if in any other way differs significantly from the description. If I have not stated that the watch has been serviced, you may wish to have this work done, particularly if you intend to wear the watch on a daily basis. On request, I can provide you with details of independent watchmakers to whom you can send your watch for servicing. I provide comprehensive details of my watches, including very clear photographs taken with a high resolution macro lens which shows detail not visible to the naked eye. I also invite you to ask questions if there is anything else you need to know. Please take care to consider the dimensions of the watch case as if it is a gentlemans\u2019 Art Deco rectangular vintage watch, they were made significantly smaller than contemporary watches. You are buying a used watch so there will be signs of use. Please do not expect quartz accuracy from a vintage watch. In the 1940\u2019s/1950\u2019s the accepted timekeeping tolerance for a new 17 jewel manual watch was within three minutes a day. All of my watches are professionally inspected and tested before sale and if they are not running smoothly and keeping reasonable time I have them serviced and/ or have any other work undertaken that is needed to ensure the watch is in running condition. However please bear in mind that a fault can develop unexpectedly at any time as with any used item so I am unable to provide any on-going warranty. Please also note that I provide no guarantee that my watches are waterproof. I would always strongly recommend keeping any vintage well away from moisture.
