Crafted in strong stainless steel and featuring warming rose gold plated details, all elements of the watch design work together to create an essential design ideal for day to evening wear. The stainless steel watch casing is round in shape, measuring 45mm in width and 13mm in depth. Plated in rose gold, the a fixed bezel frames the detailed dial, protected by a layer of sapphire crystal glass. The dial itself has a multi-tonal colour scheme, edged with a black and white minute track and drawing the eye with a central champagne section. Rose gold tone batons indicate the hours, with a smaller subdial beneath twelve showing the charge level of the watch. The recognisable Dreyfuss & Co. logo is positioned at six, along with a rose gold tone edged date window. Worn with a black croc-effect leather strap, the dark complementing colour scheme makes this watch ideal for formal occasions. The strap is fastened with a rose gold tone press buckle and the inner workings of this watch are impervious to water, meeting Dreyfuss & Co\u2019s Seafarer Standard.
