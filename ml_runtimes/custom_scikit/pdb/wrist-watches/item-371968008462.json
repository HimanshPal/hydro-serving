  "Description": "You are looking at an excellent copper or salmon faced Tag Heuer Kirium Automatic Chronometer WL5114 men's watch. It is the Tag Heuer Kirium Automatic Chronometer WL5114 model. This watch is a true survivor. This watch does not disappoint. The copper dial is rare & stunning. I own over 225 tag heuer watches (and I currently have quite a few for sale). It was simply time to clean out the closet. I am a Tag Heuer collector. The pictures do not look the best because the glass on the Kirium model is rounded and thus gives off a glare when trying to photograph. The crystal is in mint condition with no scratches. The back casing is in very good condition with a few light scratches. The bracelet is stainless steel and it is in very good to excellent condition with some light scratches. There are also light scratches on the clasp and bezel. I would rate this TAG as a 9.1 out of 10 in condition. It is beautiful. My pictures are not the best because I was getting too much light. Rest assured this watch looks great. Bezel turns nice and crisply in counter clockwise direction, as it should. The lume on the minute hand has slight discoloration. The lume dot on the second hand has disintegrated. It keeps perfect time. It is the automatic chronometer movement and 200 meters water resistant. It is the chronometer function and the chronometer works perfectly. It runs and keeps perfect time, as it should. It was sized at the jeweler and it will currently fit a size 7.5 inch wrist or smaller. In fact, if you need extra links I would be willing to sell you some at $30 per link or $25 each for two or more. I have access to them from a local jewelry store. If you want the extra links just let me know immediately after purchase so I can invoice you for them. This watch was selling for $2500 new and I am giving you a great discount. This is 100% authentic. Why pay $2500 for a brand new tag when you can buy this new one for much less? Please see my other tag heuers for sale too!!!! I will insure watch for priority mail shipping. SHIPPING IS FREE WITH BUY IT NOW. The Tag leather display is not included in the auction. Watch comes with a TAG Heuer leather case & pillow. They are in good condition showing some wear.
