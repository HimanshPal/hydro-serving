GoldWatchCo offers a full, one year, buckle-to-buckle warranty on all products. If anything goes wrong with the watch within the first year, we will send you a pre-paid, fully insured shipping label, and service the watch free of charge. The warranty covers all manufacturers defects and beyond which include: movement check, movement collaboration, full movement overhaul, watch polishing, and cleaning. \u00a0 CUSTOM DIAMOND WORK \u00a0 Every watch from GoldWatchCo that does not include diamonds, is a 100% \u201cfactory original\u201d Rolex. Even though we are not Rolex Authorized dealers and are not affiliated with Rolex USA in any way, We still service all Rolex watches with our in-house watchmaker. There are certain watches that we sell on ebay, that have diamonds, either on the dial, or on the bezel, and are custom added by our private in-house jeweler. The diamond work on our watches is considered \u2018custom\u2019 diamond work and are not Rolex diamond unless otherwise specified. All diamond work is performed according to industry standards, while the watch is still fully water proof and water resistant. AUTHENTICITY GUARANTEE GoldWatchCo guarantees that every watch sold is a 100% factory original Rolex, and is in perfect working order. Every watch includes the original box, booklets, tags, and all applicable paperwork. Every watch has the model number and the serial number intact. On most pre-owned models, the serial number and model number are located on the casing, and can only be viewed by removing the bracelet. The newer models, from 2007 on up, have the serial number located underneath the crystal, around the circumference of the dial. Every pre-owned watch receives a full polish, cleaning, and overhaul, before it is shipped to the customer. \u00a0 RETURN POLICY \u00a0 We fully understand that buying an expensive item over the internet can be a very anxious process. We therefore offer a 14 day money back Guarantee, with the first 3 business days guaranteeing no restocking fee. That allows you to have the watch fully inspected locally. After the first 3 business days there will be a 20% restocking fee. The three day period begins when you receive the product, thus, you have three business days to let us know you are returning the product without any restocking fee. When returning a watch, we require you to call our customer service department and get an RMA number. Customers without an RMA number are not eligible for a return, and the package will not be accepted. The watch must be sent back with all original boxes, booklets, tags, and all applicable paperwork. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00b7 You have 14 days from once you received it to return the product for a refund \u00b7 Initiate Shipment back ( Getting the RMA number ) within 3 business days from once you received it and pay no restocking fees \u00b7 Must receive RMA number before shipping it back \u00b7 The customer is responsible for return shipping \u00b7 Must send it back with tracking and adult signature required \u00a0 ABOUT US \u00a0 \"Our goal is to not only sell you a watch, but to create a long-lasting relationship...\" GoldWatchCo is the web's leading dealer of Rolex watches and specializes in perfect condition, unused, pre-owned and authentic luxury timepieces.
