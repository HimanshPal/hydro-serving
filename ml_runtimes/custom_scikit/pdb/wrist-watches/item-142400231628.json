From what we read this model was the first REGISTERED EDITION remake made after the ESSEX model. Made from 1985-1991. MOVEMENT: SWISS made quartz 15 jewel movement, Cal. ETA 980.163. Runs, sets and holds time good. The battery is almost dead so it is in the battery save mode. The seconds hand moves 5 seconds at a time, still holds time good. A service and a new battery is recommended. DIAL: HAMILTON signed silver dial with gold hands in excellent minty condition. CRYSTAL: Original glass crystal is clear with no chips or cracks. Few very light scratches hard to see. CASE: HAMILTON REGISTERED EDITION 6160 gold plated bezel stainless steel back case measures 23mm wide and 32mm tall, not including the the original H signed crown or lugs. Curve on the back makes it comfortable to wear. Overall in excellent condition with no wear or fading and minimal scratching. BAND: Alligator? 18mm band came on this watch. Cracked underneath from use on the 3rd hole from the top. Nice band besides that crack. Seldom seen HAMILTON 6160 quartz wristwatch in excellent condition. Although this watch runs good the battery is almost dead and may have been sitting for years. There for it is sold as is with no returns or guarantees, a service is recommended.
