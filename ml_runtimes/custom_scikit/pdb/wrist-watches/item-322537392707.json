  "Description": "BALL Engineer Dive Master GMT 300m swiss men's watch!!!! The Engineer Master II Diver GMT brings a golden aura to the BALL collection of divers watches that currently includes chronometers, chronographs and mechanical thermometers. The Engineer Master II Diver GMT is a masterpiece of color. The stainless steel case is coated in Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC), which gives it a stunning gunmetal grey coloring. Metals coated with DLC exhibit impressive hardness, low friction, high resistance to wear, and even electrical insulation. Golden accents set off the GMT display to make it easily legible. The rotating inner bezel is the first to use BALL micro gas tubes for uninterrupted light at any depth. The crowns operate underwater to adjust the time or elapsed minutes ring with no difficulty. After months of preparation and training, Guillaume N\u00e9ry reached 113 meters on Day 4 of his week of dives at Villefranche-sur-Mer in Nice, France. Strong currents in the ocean complicated measurements. There was some tension following the dive because the official depth gauge seemed to have given a faulty reading. At Ball Watch Company, they are proud to help Guillaume keep time. In continued celebration of Guillaume\u2019s amazing career in free diving, we are happy to announce a new addition to the collection of Engineer Master II Divers: the Engineer Master II Diver GMT.
