  "Description": "Montblanc TimeWalker Chronograph Automatic- 116096 Order handling time: 2 working days Color: Black Dimensions: 43 mm Material: Stainless Steel Type: Watch Movement: Quartz Bezel: Ceramic Case Material: Stainless Steel Dial Color: Black Water Resistant: 10 Bar (100 meters) Closure: Triple Deployant Strap Color: Black Strap Material: Rubber This timepiece enhances the dynamic performance with a marked alternation of black and white-silver and is inspired by the racing car's on-board equipment. The MB 25.07 caliber includes chronograph complications and small seconds at 9 o'clock. In the chronograph center seconds and in the 30-minute and 12-hour counters, vertically aligned at 6 o'clock, white-silver scales are enhanced by a small Super-LumiNova\u00ae lining and 15-minute red markings to ensure maximum readability on the black dial both day and night. The legendary red chronograph of the second seconds with arrow-shaped Minerva arrow stands out from the hours of hands and minutes of rhodium-finish rhubarb. Turning the black ceramic bezel with knurled edge, you can detect a second time. Waterproof up to 100 meters, the 43mm stainless steel case with satin finish also evokes the spirit of motor racing with its semi-skeleton axes inspired by the aerodynamic lines of classic bodywork. The rubber strap has asymmetrical holes as those of the racing gloves and a relief pattern that allows optimal transpiration and allows maximum wrist adherence. The new specially developed triple release buckle offers flexibility and maximum comfort to the wrist. To ensure maximum reliability and best performance, the timepiece was subjected to rigorous Montblanc Laboratory Test 500 tests.",
