  "Description": "Excellent Estate Collection!Rare Bulova B.F. Goodrich Silvertown Tires Promotional Pocket Watch with Original Case. This is part of a large (over 150) 30 year vintage wristwatch collection from the 1920's up to the 1970's that we will be listing in the coming weeks. Many different popular brands in both men's and ladies. Most of these have had a partial or full restoration preformed at one point when acquired, but due to the period of time that they have been in storage, we are selling these as is, as found with the recommendation that a full watch service be preformed before wearing or using these.This listing is for a Unique Rare 1945 Bulova B.F. Goodrich Promotional Tire Pocket Watch This watch features a Military Black with Radium number dial and hands that looks near perfect, a nice clear crystal, a 16J 10AK Military hacking movement that winds, sets and runs good, it has a triangle symbol that would indicate it to be a 1945 model. It seems to keep good time but we have not timed this watch for accuracy.The original wooden presentation case is in very good condition, it does show some storage wear to the velvet inside and on the outside of the case in places but is overall very nice for being 70+ years old! These are very rare to find and with the original box is super rare, don't miss out on this one for your collection! Please take a look at all of the photos, they are also part of the description, and ask any questions you may have. Be sure to check out our other great items we have listed, we will combine multiple purchases to save on shipping costs, just ask for a combined invoice before paying.All of the items we list are from local estate or auction sales and we do not clean or refurbish them other than wipe off the dust. Some of these items may have been from a pet owners or smokers home, or may have been sitting in cold storage for many years. These will be shipped via USPS Priority mail with delivery confirmation.",
