  "Description": "You are looking at a silver chronograph Tag Heuer Formula One CAH1111.BA0850 men's watch. This model does not disappoint. Model CAH1111.BA0850. I own over 225 Tag Heuer watches (and I currently have quite a few for sale). It was simply time to clean out the closet. I am a tag heuer collector. The case is 41mm.......45mm including the crown. The crystal is in mint condition. The back casing is in excellent condition with some light scratches. The bracelet is the Tag stainless steel band and it is in excellent condition showing light wear & scratches. All letters are still blacked out in the words TAG Heuer on the side case. There are also light scratches (desk rash) on the clasp. The bezel is beautiful. I would rate this TAG as a 9.3 out of 10 in condition. It is beautiful. It was probably only worn about 10x! The chronograph functions perfectly and resets to zero as it should. The bezel turns and clicks in the counter clockwise direction as it should. It keeps perfect time. It is quartz movement and 200 meters water resistant. The serial numbers are engraved on the back of the watch! Be careful because there are a lot of folks on ebay selling fakes that do not have serial numbers!! The stainless band is all original and will fit a 7.5 inch or smaller size wrist. In fact, if you need extra links I would be willing to sell you some at $20 per link or $15 each for two or more. I have access to them from a local jewelry store. If you want the extra links just let me know immediately after purchase so I can invoice you for them. It also has the rare wet-suit extender which allows someone with a larger wrist to wear it. This is 100% authentic. This is quite simply 1 of the finest tags I have ever seen. Why pay $1500 for a brand new tag when you can buy this one for much less? Please see my other Tag Heuers for sale too!!!! I will insure watch for priority mail shipping. SHIPPING IS FREE WITH BUY IT NOW. Check out my other ebay listings for other TAGS that are brand new!!!! The watch comes with the Tag box (model & serial number stickers attached), TAG case & pillow, TAG retail sticker, & TAG manual. All of the accessories are in excellent condition. CAH1111.BA0850 TAG HEUER FORMULA 1 MENS QUARTZ WATCH - With Manufacturer Serial Numbers - Silver Dial - Chronograph Feature with Laptimer - Battery Operated Quartz Movement - Guaranteed Authentic - Scratch Resistant Sapphire Crystal - Brushed Steel Case & Bracelet - Manufacturer Box & Manual - 200 Meters / 660 Feet Water Resistant - 41mm = 1 5/8\" Case, 7.5\" Adjustable Strap - Deployment Buckle - Luminescent Hands & Markers - Screw Down Crown & Caseback - Case Thickness: 12mm PLEASE SEE MY OTHER AUCTIONS FOR BRAND NEW NEVER WORN TAG HEUERS (MEN AND WOMEN). I AM CLEARING OUT MY HUGE COLLECTION. LOOK AT MY FEEDBACK. IT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF! I AM ONLY SELLING MINT CONDITION ITEMS. DO NOT TRUST THESE OTHER EBAYERS SELLING USED AND BEAT UP WATCHES. All items come from my smoke free and pet free home. Trust me as i have a 100% positive feedback rating!!!! My feedback speaks for itself! INVFI09#2625 Shipping is FREE to the USA.Shipping is $45 to most international destinations including Canada and the UK. However there are a few countries in which shipping will be higher. Australia, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries will cost more. Contact me BEFORE PURCHASING IF FROM AN INTERNATIONAL COUNTRY SO I CAN VERIFY SHIPPING COSTS.

If you are from the UK and have issues please contact me and I will change some settings so that you can purchase. Thanks",
