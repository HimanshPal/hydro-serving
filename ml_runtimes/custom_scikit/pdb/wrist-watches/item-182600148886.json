  "Description": "New in box with DATE Function on dial \"U.S. Marine Corps\" Markings on dial and back Swiss Made - New Government (GSA) Contract w/ new ETA 3 jewel movement Actual US Military issue! Not Luminox, Traser or Microtec commercial watch2 year warranty from ManufacturerLatest production -- Factory Fresh!Individual serial number (3 digits...early) engraved on back This is the newest U.S. Marine Corps Pilot/Navigator's Watch by Marathon (MIL-PRF-46374G specification). 42x46 mm. This is a special current issue watch (manufactured in 2016), USMC marked and laser engraved back, Tritium Tracer (Glass Tubes) Navigational Wristwatch that glows 20 times brighter than an ordinary luminous watch. The design and reliability is the same as the legendary Navigator watch produced by Marathon in various forms since the late 1980s and features a date window as well as red tipped seconds hand. The timepiece features a high quality Swiss made high precision 3 jewel Quartz Movement (ETA caliber F06.111) designed to withstand high G-forces and has a magnetic resistance of 1500 A/m. It has a end of battery life indicator feature as well. The watch is water resistant to 6 ATM (196 Ft) but is not a diving watch so continuous water immersion is not recommended. It is designed for maintaining accuracy at high altitude to 35,000 FT without compensating pressurization. This is the authentic 1st quality military item and not the commercial, military style \"Navy Seals\" watch available to the general public marketed by Luminox nor the watches manufactured by MB-Microtec (Mil-W-46374F copies). The watch measures 44x48mm (not including the crown) with a 20mm lug width (strap size). This watch is powered by a NEW Eveready Energizer 395 watch battery, and is accurate to +/- 21 seconds per month (mine is actually right on after many weeks!). By pulling the crown out, the second hand is stopped (hacked) for synchronization. 12 O'clock illuminated in red. Easy to read at night. Very lightweight and stylish. Watch is manufactured to MIL-46374G specifications. Stainless steel back is stamped as follows: WATCH. WRIST: NAVIGATOR WITH DATE MIL-PRF-46374G Type III, Class 1 WW194013USMC-SG26 MILLICURIES NRC ID: 54-28526-01E GS-14F-0027K CAGE 38776SER: MC/** This is a great looking timepiece that is actual military issue and has met rigorous military specifications. It is not a factory second or government rejected watch. The case is is made of an extremely durable black nylon/fiberglass composite material. The rotating outer bezel provides marking for a second time zone. The crystal is an aircraft quality lightweight Lexon material allowing for strength and scratch removal. The dial features the radioactive symbol (Tritium isotope). Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. When it decays, it emits beta particles (electrons) that do not penetrate skin, plastic, glass, etc. The electrons excite the coating on the vials, creating a bright green glow. It is a safe (but very expensive) method of illumination, and is used mainly in military watches and gun sights. This is brand new and comes complete with black nylon flight strap (watch can be worn on the wrist or over one's flight jacket) and original box & instructions! 3 day return privilege after receipt of item if not delighted. For prompt, easy delivery, we ship from either USA or Europe depending on the destination. We have been selling Marathon product since 1996. Don't settle for imitations or rejected material. Why not own an original, first quality, authentic, current military issue watch from the oldest AUTHORIZED MARATHON AGENT with full manufacturer's warranty?
