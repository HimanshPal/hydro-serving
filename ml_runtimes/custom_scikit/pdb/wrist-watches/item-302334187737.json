  "Description": "chapelle_jewellery Visit our eBay Shop Add us to your Favourites list > Subscribe to our Newsletter > About Chapelle Delivery The Chapelle Guarantee Men\u2019s Dreyfuss & Co. 1953 chronograph white watch DGB00032/06 RRP \u00a3675.00 Now \u00a3395.00 Description Handmade in Switzerland, this men\u2019s Dreyfuss & Co. 1953 family chronograph bracelet watch is crafted in stainless steel and has a bright white dial. Contrasting textures add to the eye catching design of this watch, with a combination of functions ensuring the practicality of this timepiece. Three contrasting black chronograph dials sit within the central round dial, edged with white numbering indicating the timing and seconds functions. The outer dial features silver tone rectangular batons at the hourly positions, slimmer black notches marking the interim minutes. The Dreyfuss & Co. logo sits beneath twelve o\u2019clock atop the white diamond textured face, along with a square date window at the fourth hour. Surrounding the stainless steel casing, a black bezel marked with minutes ensures the reliability and clarity of the chronograph functions. The chronograph functions are controlled by two buttons either side of the stainless steel crown. Also crafted in stainless steel, the bracelet strap also contributes to the textured design, with the flexible links complementing the silver tone hour markers. The strap is fastened with a push button clasp, and links can be removed to ensure a more comfortable fit. The watch casing measures approximately 39mm in width and 11.5mm in depth. This watch, as with all Dreyfuss & Co. watches, is guaranteed to be of their Seafarer Standard.
