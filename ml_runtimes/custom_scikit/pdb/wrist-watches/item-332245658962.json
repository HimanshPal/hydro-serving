History of Marvin brand (data from web):\"Marvin is not a new brand. Dating back to 1850, Marvin has a rich and interesting history. Marvin didn\u2019t begin as \u201cMarvin\u201d. It was founded in 1850 in Berne, Switzerland by the brothers Marc and Emmanuel Didisheim as a small watchmaking operation that finished watches using parts from outside suppliers. The first factory proper was opened in 1891 under the name Albert Didisheim et Freres, referring to Marc Didisheim\u2019s sons who took over the operation. In 1893 the Marvin name was registered. The name \u201cMarvin\u201d came about when the Didisheims began to introduce their products into the American market, starting in 1893 in New York. The name \u201cAlbert Didisheim et Freres\u201d didn\u2019t quite have the marketing punch needed in the US market, so the company took the name of their US distributor \u2013 Marvin. By 1905 Marvin was the principal name of the company but it was still run by the Didisheim family, who had now moved operations from Berne to La Chaux-de-Fonds. Marvin quickly established itself as a brand that provided good design and quality finishing for reasonable money. In 1912 it became a true \u201cmanufacture\u201d producing all of its components in-house. It had a state-of-the-art facility and a reputation for excellent treatment of its employees. Through the middle of the 20th century Marvin expanded and made a name for itself through motorsports sponsorship, international distribution, celebrity \u201cendorsements\u201d (Marilyn Monroe and Che Guevera both wore Marvins), and producing high quality movements for other brands. The success of Marvin peaked in the 1950s and 60s, by which point the company had produced nearly 7 million watches. The 1970s, however, were a different story. The introduction of the quartz movement in the late 60s by the Swiss industry was heralded as a breakthrough in high-technology timekeeping. Ironically, it would result in the near total destruction of the Swiss watch industry. While the first quartz movements were very expensive and occupied the upper end of the market, the second generation produced by Asian manufacturers were very inexpensive and still highly accurate and reliable. The influx of cheap Asian quartz watches effectively killed the traditional mechanical watch industry. Hundreds of brands and suppliers folded, were liquidated, or were consolidated into larger groups of companies. Very few brands survived unscathed. Marvin was a victim of the \u201cQuartz Crisis\u201d and was absorbed into the Manufactures d\u2019Horlogerie Suisses Reunies (MSR) conglomerate in 1970. The brand subsequently disappeared, aside from a few offerings during the 1980s and 1990s, after MSR absorbed the manufacturing facilities. In 2002 the Marvin brand was purchased from MSR by Cecile and Jean-Daniel Maye, who had previously run Time Avenue and Nina Ricci. The story goes that the Mayes were interested in the history and strength of the Marvin name, and approached the descendants of the Didisheims about purchasing the rights to restart the brand. After much back and forth, they finally agreed and Marvin was reborn.\" Bidding/Buying: I do this as hobby, because I like timepieces, so money is not the prime interest. Price posted here is according to my estimation and knowledge. Every watch will be inspected, checked and serviced if needed before sending. Feel free to send best offers. Please bear in mind that EMS post service cost is 20$ and it is included in this price, so send fair price offers. Please bear in mind that I collect watches, hunt for good pieces, examine, take to professional watchmaker for service etc. So some time and effort is invested in every watch I sell. Also, since I take every watch to professional watchmaker, certain warranty period of 6 months stands for every watch, under normal warranty conditions, meaning there is no physical damage covered. I'm trying to be as honest as possible about every detail, no hidden stuff is possible as far as I'm concerned.
