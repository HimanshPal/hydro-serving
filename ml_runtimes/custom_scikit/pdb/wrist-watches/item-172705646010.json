  "Description": "This fabulous near new old stock Bulova Accutron watch, manufactured in 1977, is a great looking timepiece in superb overall condition. It comes with its original presentation box and tags. The watch was presented to a Mr Thomas Green as a safe driving award in 1977. It is clear from the condition of the watch, the tags still attached and the signed and unused lizard calf strap that this watch was never used but stored away in its presentation box for the last forty years. It is a piece of watchmaking history, manufactured in the year the quartz version of the Accutron was first introduced. 1977 was also the year the last tuning fork Accutron came off the production line, at which time over four million tuning fork timepieces had been manufactured. This watch has a 10 carat rolled gold case, the factory original dial which looks superb and a quartz movement which is running perfectly and keeping time. The quick set day/date function is working correctly. The watch is signed in six places, on the case, dial, crown. movement genuine lizard calf strap and buckle. Please note that replacement batteries are readily available for this watch. If you are looking for one of these models you will be hard pressed to find a better example so do not less this watch pass you by.

I have consistently received excellent feedback and many repeat buyers. Customer satisfaction is very important to me so if you do have any problems please get in touch. I will always do my best to help. I often assist customers who ask for my help several years after they have purchased a watch from me; so once you have bought a watch, you will remain an important customer. You can email me at jackanpet123@gmail.com to ask any questions. Please scroll down to see more photographs and details.

In order to receive Paypal\u2019s protection service, for which I pay a fee, they require me to send the watch to you with full on line tracking and a signature on delivery. The cost of using the courier service is \u00a355-\u00a360 GBP to most countries but I will shoulder part of the cost and charge you just 34.95 GBP.

Overseas buyers: At my discretion I will accept other forms of payment but accept STERLING only. Please contact me if you wish to do this before the auction ends. Terms of Sale I pack my watches very well to avoid damage but very occasionally a problem may occur due to rough treatment in transit or the use of scanning equipment by Customs or the postal services which can magnetise the watch mechanism. I warrant that the watch you purchase will, when you receive it, be as described in the listing. If there is a problem when you receive your purchase I provide a no quibble full refund option. Alternatively I will undertake any repairs that are necessary if the watch is damaged or if in any other way differs significantly from the description. If I have not stated that the watch has been serviced, you may wish to have this work done, particularly if you intend to wear the watch on a daily basis. On request, I can provide you with details of independent watchmakers to whom you can send your watch for servicing. I provide comprehensive details of my watches, including very clear photographs taken with a high resolution macro lens which shows detail not visible to the naked eye. I also invite you to ask questions if there is anything else you need to know. Please take care to consider the dimensions of the watch case as if it is a gentlemans\u2019 Art Deco rectangular vintage watch, they were made significantly smaller than contemporary watches. You are buying a used watch so there will be signs of use. Please do not expect quartz accuracy from a vintage watch. In the 1940\u2019s/1950\u2019s the accepted timekeeping tolerance for a new 17 jewel manual watch was within three minutes a day. All of my watches are professionally inspected and tested before sale and if they are not running smoothly and keeping reasonable time I have them serviced and/ or have any other work undertaken that is needed to ensure the watch is in running condition. However please bear in mind that a fault can develop unexpectedly at any time as with any used item so I am unable to provide any on-going warranty. Please also note that I provide no guarantee that my watches are waterproof. I would always strongly recommend keeping any vintage well away from moisture.
