  "Description": "This watch is brand new and is in original box with tag and warranty declaration. Works as intended PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU WANT THE ITEM AND IT IS THE ONE YOU WANT BEFORE YOU ENTER INTO A BINDING CONTRACT!! Return PolicyI do not offer returns, unless an item is misrepresented in the listing, damaged, or if the buyer doesn\u2019t receive the item. However, ALL of my items are covered by the eBay 100% satisfaction guarantee policy so bid or purchase with confidence. My goals are:\u2022To ensure that every transaction is a positive one\u2022To ensure that every customer feels as if they have received a great product at a great value. \u2022To make every transaction efficient and effortless as possible for both parties, leaving everyone involved with a Zen like vibe (kidding about the Zen thing but if you're looking for drama, shop elsewhere please!) PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU WANT THE ITEM AND IT IS THE ONE YOU WANT BEFORE YOU ENTER INTO A BINDING CONTRACT!! When you buy something and decide you can get it cheaper elsewhere, or accidentally hit the buy button 3 times by mistake, or don't have money for it because someone hacked your PayPal account and cancel the purchase, you remove the item from the market and cause the seller to lose any watchers and potentially preventing a real sell. Do us all a favor and make sure you want it BEFORE you buy it!! It's just good business to do that! If you do find fault in a product, item or listing, please contact me first and I'll see what I can do to make the situation right. Do not leave feedback in haste because you will lose the respect from all sellers because you are affecting the livelihood of others just to look like a badass that hides behind the internet. Just try to be civil with the buyers first. Remember We're not Sam Walton or Walmart therefore most of us have limited resources and rely on our reputations of our businesses.",
