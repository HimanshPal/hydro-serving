  "Description": "chapelle_jewellery Visit our eBay Shop Add us to your Favourites list > Subscribe to our Newsletter > About Chapelle Delivery The Chapelle Guarantee Men\u2019s Dreyfuss & Co. 1974 Quartz Rectangular Dial DGB00007/21 RRP \u00a3575.00 Now \u00a3325.00 Description A sleek design, this men\u2019s Dreyfuss & Co. 1974 Quartz watch is suitable for both everyday wear and formal occasions. Crafted in stainless steel, the watch features an expander bracelet strap, fastened with a push button clasp. The rectangular watch case has a fixed bezel, framing the white rectangular dial, which is textured with a diamond-shape pattern. Roman numerals mark the surrounding hours, with a square date window positioned at the three o\u2019clock position. A subdial is located at the six o\u2019clock position, clearly showing the seconds as they pass. Deep blue watch hands create a contrast against the dial, with a clear minute track surrounding the hour markers. The dial is protected by a layer of strong sapphire crystal glass. Powered by a Quartz movement, this Swiss-made watch is guaranteed to meet the Dreyfuss & Co. Seafarer Standard of waterproofing. This means this watch can be worn during water sports and other water activities.
