Its stainless steel case is surrounded by rich tones of rose gold plating, complementing the black genuine leather strap, which is securely fastened with a push button clasp. A classic design, the cream watch face has three black subdials within the main dial, displaying chronograph and timing functions, edged with rose gold plating and white notches. The main watch dial itself is marked with rose gold batons to indicate the hours, standing out boldly against the white face and the slim black minute track that surrounds it. The slim rose gold tone watch hands also create a contrast against the design, ensuring the time can clearly be read. The watch face itself is protected by strong sapphire crystal glass, and features a square date window at four o\u2019clock. The watch casing measures approximately 12.5mm in depth and 39mm in width.
