  "Description": "BOHLE FE 233-66 France Ebauches hand winding watch The FE 233-66 is directly related to the caliber 233-60, but contains an additional day indication and has got a slightly larger main plate. Both movements were derived from the Cupillard 233.The rest of the construction is identical; the 233-66 uses a ring balance, which is beared in two Incabloc shock protection systems (which is a bit unusual for french movements), beats with only 18000 A/h and regulates a traditional pallet anchor movement. Technically, this movement, which was produced in the seventies, seems quite outdated, but it was still popular nevertheless.The \"decoration\" of the bridges is quite crude, a typical sign of the 70ies.
