  "Description": "I am offering a rare vintage Ruhla German wrist watch. It is in working condition. There are a few scratches and the glass is slightly cracked but having in mind the watch's age and rarity it is suitable for a collection or use. The case diameter is 34mm without the crown. You receive exactly what you see in the pictures. This watch is tested, works well and keeps good time (don\u2019t expect quartz accuracy). It is cleaned and oiled but please have in mind that this is an old used hand-winding watch and I cannot guarantee for its further work. If you have a problem please contact me before leaving negative or neutral feedback. I will do my best to resolve any problem that had occurred. Shipping: Shipping to European countries takes between 5 to 10 working days. For countries outside of Europe shipping takes between 15 to 25 working days, so please be patient.
