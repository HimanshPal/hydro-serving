  "Description": "chapelle_jewellery Visit our eBay Shop Add us to your Favourites list > Subscribe to our Newsletter > About Chapelle Delivery The Chapelle Guarantee Mens Accurist diamond black ceramic bracelet watch MB952 RRP \u00a3200.00 Now \u00a375.00 Description This sleek, modern design MB952 from Accurist watches creates a smart monochrome look that is perfect for the stylish gentleman. The classic combination of black and white is giving a contemporary twist in this mens Accurist watch MB952 by the use of black ceramic for the watch case and bracelet. Silver tone hands and batons mark the hours, contrasting against the black dial. The perfect finishing touch is the diamond set at the twelve o'clock position that gives this watch an extra luxurious feel. The gleaming black bracelet has a highly polished finish that is emphasised by the angular shape of the links. These taper towards the back of this mens designer watch MB952 where it fastens with a secure push-button clasp. This Accurist designer watch MB952 is 30m water resistant, making it suitable for everyday wear, and has a stainless steel case-back. Ceramic is also hypo-allergenic although care should be taken with ceramic watches as high force impacts can shatter the material. We are authorised stockists of Accurist and this watch comes in the official, original packaging and with a 2 year manufacturer's warranty.
