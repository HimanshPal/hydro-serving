Jewelry Care Guide: Remove jewelry during tasks \u2013 When performing manual tasks, remove your jewelry to prevent physical damage or exposure to chemicals or cleaning fluids. Some tasks that should be avoided when wearing jewelry include kitchen work, gardening, cleaning the house and other common tasks. Put jewelry on after applying makeup \u2013 Cosmetics, hairspray, perfumes and lotion can contain chemicals that can often damage jewelry. Putting jewelry on after applying these materials will limit exposure to jewelry and any potential damage. Don't wear jewelry in swimming pools and spas \u2013 Chlorinated water can react with the metals found in jewelry causing color changes and even structural damage. As a result it's a good idea to remove jewelry before entering the pool or spa. Contact sports and jewelry don't mix \u2013 Hard blows during sports can damage jewelry not to mention the people involved. All jewelry should be removed before play begins. Remove your jewelry before bathing - Remove all jewelry before showering or cleaning. Soap can cause a film to form, making it appear dull and dingy. By preventing the formation of this film you immediately reduce the occasions of servicing. Use jewelry polishing cloths for best results - Polish silver or gold with a jewelry polishing cloth for best results. Use of tissue or paper towels can cause scratches because of fibers in these products. Clean jewelry with care - Cleaning your own jewelry regularly can keep it looking good, but be careful. You can either purchase commercial cleaners from a jeweler or make a cleaning a solution yourself. Rubbing alcohol can work wonders, but bleach can literally destroy jewelry so avoid it at all costs. Use warm water to clean jewelry - Using warm water is the best bet when cleaning your own jewelry. How water can cause reaction with the cleaning fluids resulting in discoloration and Sterling Silver is especially susceptible to this problem. Should this occur, this problem can be remedied by buffing and the application of a tarnish remover. Avoid cleaning damaged jewelry - Never clean any jewelry that is damaged, cracked or broken, since the additional handling is likely to exacerbate or worsen the problem. If you find that a piece of jewelry is damaged, it should be set aside for repair as soon as possible.",
