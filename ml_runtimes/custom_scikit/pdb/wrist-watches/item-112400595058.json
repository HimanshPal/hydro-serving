  "Description": "I have for sale an used vintage Omega automatic in a yellow gold clad case over stainless steel. There is some wear through around the rim of the bezel and lugs but it still looks good. The watch has been cleaned, oiled and regulated to keep time. The watch has a new plastic crystal, genuine omega crown and main spring installed. The dial has a nice original patina looks very good. The markers and wording is a little washed out but still legible The watch came from a watch makers estate. The dial is original but is showing it's age and has Swiss Made on the bottom of the dial. The Omega movement caliber 354 bumper Automatic is in great clean condition. The case diameter is 34.5mm and 42.5mm from lug-to-lug.
