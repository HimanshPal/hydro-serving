  "Description": "FINAL PRICE REDUCTION!!!! GET IT BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE DOES. WILL GO FAST. DO NOT BID IF YOU CAN'T PAY!!! Up for sale is a 1940's Vintage Cartier Tank Mechanical Square Wristwatch on Solid 14k Yellow Gold. This is a collectors Dream find and a chance to get it for much less than only other one on internet. VERY RARE!! The IDENTICAL watch is on here with a $7,900 asking price under same title., but with black band. Measures 20mm x 20mm without crown. Case and movement made by Concord for Cartier. Founded in 1908 in Biel, Switzerland the brand was created to design watches with the American market in mind. Concord has made several innovations in its history such as being one of the first \u201cprivate label\u201d luxury watches to incorporate precious metals and gems in its watches. It was also the first company to make a wristwatch made of coins. In 1915 Concord started working with companies like Van Cleef & Arpels, Tiffany & Co. and Cartier (jeweler) on providing them with high quality watches made out of precious metals and gems. In 1942 President Truman gifted Concord watches to Stalin and Churchill during World War II peace talks, solidifying their position as a leading luxury watch. Band, clasp and Crown aren't Original. Everything that matters is. Starting Auction at $.99 and we'll see where it goes. Has been explained EXACTLY as it is and therefore there are no returns. Just serviced so running perfectly, BUT has not been tested for accuracy so making no guarantees on the accuracy of watch, just that it's in perfect working order.On Jan-31-17 at 19:35:39 PST, seller added the following information: Also, other one has a $20k replacement value.On Jan-31-17 at 19:37:14 PST, seller added the following information: PLEASE SEE OTHER RARE 1940s CARTIER LISTEDOn Feb-03-17 at 09:55:44 PST, seller added the following information: Only one I've ever seen with an Upwards facing V at 5 o'clock. Dont know if that was an error or on purpose, but just adds to the rarity.",
