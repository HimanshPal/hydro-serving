  "Description": "Genuine BMW Titanium Automatic Chronograph !!! Discontinued model from late 1990's. Limited edition, you will own #2166. Swiss made. Ultra rare as in top condition, complete with original box. Screw-on crown. Sapphire crystal and tungsten carbide top ring. Full titanium case. Super rare medium sized case, impossible to find it nowadays.The chronograph has a high degree of sporty functionality, reliability and precision as regards both technology and design. The exquisite Valjoux movement has been put together and regulated purely by hand in separate production. This chronograph has a Sapphire crystal and a top ring made of tungsten carbide. In their hardness, both materials are surpassed only by diamond. The case is made of titanium, a material which is distinguished by it's anti-allergic properties and it's low specific gravity.A high grade full titanium case that has a BMW logotype engraved at 6 o'clock, a curved design for a comfortable wear on the wrist, screw-on crown for extra protection from shocks and humidity, a top ring made of tungsten carbide and a curved Sapphire crystal, will safeguard your precious timepiece for many years to come. A deep black dial with a Tachymeter scale on it, red to complement the sporty design, three sub-dial counters in the classic configuration and crisp white hour and minute markers, will flatter any wrist with it's elegant design. Luminous hour markers and hour and minute hands. The snap-on titanium back, makes the watch water resistant to 5 ATM. It is secured on your wrist by a black fine sharkskin band with white top stitching and closes with a stainless steel deployment clasp.The BMW products in the automotive and engine sector represent the peak of engineering. The BMW Chronograph with automatic winding and titanium case shares this characteristic, being a top quality product of the art of Swiss watchmaking. It is manufactured, finished and regulated in accordance with the state of the art in watch making. It fits the contour of the wrist excellently thanks to the highly rounded shape of the case. The rounded sapphire crystal has a hardness of 9 Mohs. Since only diamond is harder, it is very resistant to scratches. To match this, tungsten carbide has been used for the bezel. This is again an extremely hard, scratch-resistant material. The use of titanium as the case material also makes sense. Although this metal is twice as difficult to work as stainless steel, it is only half as heavy. Moreover, titanium is anti-magnetic, resistant to corrosion and - undoubtedly by far it's greatest advantage - extremely skin friendly. The latte is particularly appreciated by people with a nickel allergy. The clear, mate black face in conjunction with the highly contrasting hands guarantees excellent readability.Curved Sapphire crystal. Diamond hardness is 10, Sapphire is 9 on the Mohs scale of hardness. Virtually scratch proof.ATTENTION !!! I also have another one, used, in like new condition, with original box and papers.
