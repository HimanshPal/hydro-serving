Good shape , a few scuffs to case and crystal, due to age. +++FREE SHIPPING+++Sorry, We do not ship outside of the USA. Please see additional disclaimers below.We find interesting timepieces and do our best to clean them up (new band when needed) , without altering the uniqueness of each vintage watch. We revel in finding a great vintage watch, and offering it up at an affordable vintage price. Please note, we are watch enthusiasts, but we are NOT watchmakers. We do not remove the back of any watches to view or touch any of the mechanisms. Please look at the pictures as a guide of the exterior condition of each timepiece. Please ask questions prior to bidding, as vintage watch sales are \"as is\" .No Returns. Watch size listings in MM are estimates. Please note that they are not exact. Only the item in the listing is for sale. Any other props in the pictures are only that, props. Also take into account that colors on computer monitors vary in degrees and the flash overdoes the contrast. Pre owned vintage watches are used and will need periodic service. They do not have the feel or look of a new watch. Please keep this in mind while bidding.",
