  "Description": "U.S. Military Field Watch by Marathon (MIL-PRF-46374G, Type I, Class 1) -- Genuine & new in box w/ instructions! Rare date model!SWISS MADE One of my favorite military watches for actual use....This is a current issue general purpose field watch with date feature (manufactured in 2016), US Army and Marine Corps Tritium Tracer (H3 Glass Tubes) Field Wristwatch that glows 20 times brighter than an ordinary luminous watch. This type of watch is current government issue to field personnel requiring a traditional reliable, accurate quartz watch. This one keeps great time and operates flawlessly. The Tritium H3 illumination is fresh and very bright! This is the only quartz (battery powered) field watch with date feature currently issued. The timepiece features a high quality Swiss made high precision jeweled ETA hack movement designed to withstand tough field use and can be stopped to synchronize the watch to a master time source. The watch is water resistant to 3 ATM (98 Ft..designed to withstand light water exposure such as splashes but it not designed for continuous water immersion....not for swimming or showering). This watch is a nicely proportioned 34x40mm not including the crown with a lug width of 16mm (strap size). It is designed for maintaining accuracy to within 0.7 sec./day in all types of environments (my own is dead on accurate after weeks of use). This is the authentic 1st quality military item and not the commercial, military style \"Navy Seals\" watch available to the general public marketed by Luminox nor the watches manufactured by MB-Microtec. 12 O'clock illuminated in red. Easy to read at night. Very lightweight and stylish. Watch is manufactured to MIL-46374G specifications. The back of the watch features military nomenclature. Black military face features both 12 and 24 hour timing with white numerals and a sweep second hand. Luminous hands and hour markings are powered by tritium tubes. This Swiss made watch comes with black nylon mil-spec strap with buckle closure that adjusts to most wrist sizes. The strap is manufactured in accordance with MIL-S-46383B, Type II. This is a great looking timepiece that is actual military issue and has met rigorous military specifications. It is not a factory second or government rejected watch....and you can buy it now for a great price! The case is is made of an extremely durable black nylon/fiberglass composite material. The crystal is an aircraft quality lightweight Lexan material allowing for strength and easy scratch removal. The dial features the radioactive symbol (Tritium isotope). Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. When it decays, it emits beta particles (electrons) that do not penetrate skin, plastic, glass, etc. The electrons excite the coating on the vials, creating a bright green glow. It is a safe (but very expensive) method of illumination, and is used mainly in military watches and gun sights. This is new in government brown fiberboard box with instructions. It comes complete with a new black nylon strap! There is a 30-day return privilege if not properly described. Makes a great gift too! Don't settle for imitations or rejected material. Why not own an original, first quality, authentic, current military issue watch? Collector note: This watch is also available in OD/Sage green with matching band. Please contact me if you would like this color instead. I have been collecting military watches for over 25 years and am a member of the National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors (NAWCC). Please feel free contact me with any questions. Check out my other items too!",
