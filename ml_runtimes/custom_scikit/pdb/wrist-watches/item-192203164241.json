  "Description": "Untitled Document RARE! 20s Antique GRUEN Guild 885 CUSHION ART DECO SWISS WATCH MEN 14K GF I am pleased to offer this extremely rare, nicely preserved and restored GRUEN in cushion shaped, Art Deco model from the late 20s with amazing design, this is a real classic. Ready to gift, wear or add to your collection! Movement: State of the art GRUEN Swiss manual wind movement. This is a fine large 885 Guild caliber, running well on 15 jewels. The movement is working well and clean, keeping good time.

Dial & Hands : 100% ORIGINAL FACTORY MADE Sterling silver dial with hard enamel print. This is THE original dial from the factory, it is not refinished. The dial has had its radium luminous material removed as originally it contained hazardious radioactive substance. Instead Super-Luminova with simulated radium-tone was manually applied on the original design and now the dial is glowing nicely in the dark and hazard-free! With original set of hands. Tip for collectors: Despite popular demand for refinished clean dials, I am aware of collectors' search and sensitivity for original dials. Therefore any dials known to be refinished, will be clearly mentioned in the dial section of the description. Otherwise, dial is believed to be 100% original. Size: Measures 27 mm side to side (excluding crown) and 35 mm lug to lug.
