  "Description": "You are looking at a RARE BLACK FACED Tag Heuer Formula One CAC1110.BA0850 men's watch. This model does not disappoint. Model CAC1110.BA0850. I own over 225 Tag Heuer watches (and I currently have quite a few for sale). It was simply time to clean out the closet. I am a Tag Heuer collector. The case on this Tag measures 41mm...........45mm across if you include the crown. The crystal is in mint condition. The back casing is in excellent condition with some fine scratches. It still has the factory sticker attached for the most part. The bracelet is a stainless steel TAG Heuer band and it is in excellent condition, showing only a few light scratches. There is light desk rash & scratches on the clasp. The black bezel is in excellent condition with no marks. I would rate this TAG as a 9.5 out of 10 in condition. It is beautiful. The bezel turns and clicks in the counter clockwise direction as it should. It keeps perfect time. It is quartz movement and 200 meters water resistant. The band will currently fit a size 8 inch wrist. If you need extra links I would be willing to sell you some at $20 per link or $15 each for two or more links. I have access to them from a local jewelry store. If you want the extra links just let me know immediately after purchase so I can invoice you for them. It also has the rare wetsuit extension, which allows those with bigger wrists to wear it. The chrono function works perfectly on the watch. It starts, stops, and resets to zero as it should. The black rubber bumpers on both sides of the case are in perfect condition. Most watches like this one have those rubber bumpers all torn up....but not this watch! This is 100% authentic. This is quite simply 1 of the finest tags I have ever seen. Why pay $2500 for a brand new tag when you can buy this one for much less? Please see my other Tag Heuers for sale too!!!! I will insure watch for priority mail shipping. SHIPPING IS FREE WITH BUY IT NOW. Watch comes with the TAG box, TAG leather case & pillow, TAG warranty card, & TAG booklet. All accessories are in excellent condition. The leather case is in fair condition, showing some wear and leather flaking.
