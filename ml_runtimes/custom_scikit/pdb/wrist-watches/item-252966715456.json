  "Description": "Thank you for visiting our ebay store! Manufacturer's Description: What is this about? Most science and engineering educational projects are replicas of something else. In building a small robot, a miniature car, a model bridge or airplane, you learn the related concepts but it's not the real thing, it's a toy. In this project, you will perform the same task many professional engineers do, reverse engineering. You will tear down an automotive production part used in millions of vehicles. This is not a model or simulation; it is the actual part and comprehensive engineering analysis. The goal of this project is for participants to learn about practical engineering concepts including logical problem solving, analytical skills, and observational assessment used in many professions. This project will involve students in activities performed by automotive engineers including mechanical and electrical analysis, design evaluation, effective communication, and decision-making based on factors related to both business and technical requirements. This hands-on project will expose students to engineering tasks and provide insight to know if an applied science discipline, like engineering, would be an exciting career to pursue. This kit includes the automotive part, tools, and workbook to take the student systematically through the same processes as an engineer to analyze the part. The workbook is arranged in five textbook lessons complete with questions to determine the student's comprehension and pursue additional study of the concepts presented. Kit contents: Automotive Actuator, Instructional Workbook (five textbook lessons and questions), Battery Holder, Screwdriver, Pliers. (Not Included: 8 AA batteries) - Hands-on enginering project kit - Teaches about electrical and mechanical engineering - Encourages further study into technical careers - Self-contained activity, no additional tools or supplies required (except batteries) - Perfect classroom kit, independant study, or family activity Electro-Mechanical Reverse Engineering Project",
