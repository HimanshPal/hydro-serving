  "Description": "chapelle_jewellery Visit our eBay Shop Add us to your Favourites list > Subscribe to our Newsletter > About Chapelle Delivery The Chapelle Guarantee Gents Rotary TIMEPIECES roman watch RRP \u00a3145.00 Now \u00a375.00 Description This TIMEPIECES watch has been designed for Rotary to be a classic watch that can last you a lifetime- certified by Rotary\u2019s lifetime warranty. The bracelet strap of this Gents watch is made from a mixture of polished and matte stainless steel. The bracelet strap has adjustable links and a push button folding clasp, which is very small and does not take up any vital space of this watch. The dial is of a standard watch size, measuring approximately 39 mm at its widest point. On this watch, the dial is relatively simple in style, and the only addition feature it obtains is a small date and day window. This simplistic design gives the bracelet watch an elegant feel, emphasised by the Roman numerals that have been used to mark each hour. All Rotary watches are classed as \u2018waterproof\u2019, meaning that they are Dolphin Standard- i.e. suitable for swimming, shallow diving and general water sports.
