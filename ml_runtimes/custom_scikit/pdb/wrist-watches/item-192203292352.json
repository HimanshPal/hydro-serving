  "Description": "DescriptionThe Starfish is a casual sport watch with an easy to read dial and a laid back look. The watch comes at a great size, about 42mm wide and 12mm thick. It has great presence on the wrist, but is thin enough to be tucked under the cuff. There is an exhibition case back and behind the tinted crystal is the famous 46943 caliber movement. The bezel is brushed like the rest of the case. The Starfish comes with a well-made leather band that serves to dress the watch up and is perfect for everyday wear.Men / Women:MenPower Reserve:Approximately 40 hoursCrystal:MineralMovement:ORIENT Cal. 46943 Automatic Mov\u2019tClasp:BuckleWater Resistance:50mCase Material:Stainless SteelCase Diameter:42mm without crownCase Thickness:12mmDial Color:BlackBezel Material:Stainless SteelBezel Function:UnidirectionalCalendar:Day/DateBand Material:Leather (Black)Lug Width:22mmWarranty Type:1 Year Orient Watch Warranty Shipping:Shipping via Registered Airmail Service is free everywhere.
