The watch has vibrant blue casing and a contrasting bright white strap, mirroring the colours of R2D2 itself. The watch casing also has two buttons upon the side, one to adjust the time upon the analogue display, and another that illuminates the multicoloured flashing lights set inside the watch. The numbers 12, 3, 6 and 9 are clearly marked in a silver tone, with circular notches representing the other hours on the analogue display. The watch hands are also in silver tone, contrasting against the image of R2D2 and ensuring they can be read.
