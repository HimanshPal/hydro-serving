I am known as a watch freak from my friends and time to time I receive watches as gifts. This watch was also gifted to me recently with one other colorway which I am keeping and listing this Graphite color, Salt & Pepper look. The minimalist face of The Bradley Compass in Graphite features raised hour markers brushed with a hint of color. The Graphite markers exhibit a deep blend of azure and slate. Crafted from a blend of stainless steel and aluminum, the case body of The Bradley Compass boasts a lighter shade than its classic counterpart. The wristband is fashioned from a blended salt and pepper gray canvas strap paired with a soft cr\u00e8me leather interior, creating an ideal finishing touch.The Bradley timepiece features a triangular marker for twelve, and elongated markers for three, six and nine in order to increase tactile legibility. The ball bearing on the inside of the markers indicates the minute, and the ball bearing running along the outer edge of the watch face indicates the hour.
