  "ConditionDescription": "Watch is generally in very fine condition. Shows  a few very minor scratches on left  and right of case. Crystal is excellent - no dings or chips.  Red leather band is nearly new; shows a little bend at lowest hole (tightest setting.).  Runs very accurately. Is missing two case back screws, and probably is not water resistant (has been opend to change battery which is new), so keep it away from water..  Other questions. let us know.",

  "Description": "INVICTA LUPAH GRAND DRAGON 2096 SWISS STAINLESS STEEL STRAP WATCH - GENTLY USED Here is an Invicta Lupah Grand Dragon #2096 with red leather strap. (Lead picture is a stock photo - all other pics are the actual watch itself).This watch has a thick case and strap, great for a gentlemen or woman that enjoys wearing something of substance on their wrists. Here is what we found out about this watch:- The light cream analog face has large size, silver stylized Arabic numerals and luminous hands with a sweep second hand. Its crystal is dome shaped and made of a mineral. However, probably the most notable visual feature is the chronograph that resembles a smiling face.There are three clearly visible sub-dials which measure 30 minutes, 60 seconds and 1/10 of a second of elapsed time.The Invicta Dragon Lupah watch has a meticulously designed, bulbous shaped crown and pushers. This is yet another reason why this timepiece lives up to its monumental and legendary name, Dragon. This Invicta watch is not water resistant.The curve shaped case of this model 2096 from the Invicta\u2019s Lupah series is made of a combination of polished and brushed stainless-steel; iTo insure that this Invicta watch, from the Lupah line of products, keeps the accurate time, this watch is supplied with a reliable, Swiss made, quartz ETA 1/60 split-second chronograph movement .The bracelet of this Invicta Lupah chronograph is another important feature that separates it from the competition. It is a red Lorica strap, made in Italy, of microfiber blend. It is comfortable to wear and it has a similar feel as leather. This special synthetic material insures that the band of the watch is resistible to water, stains, scratches and fade. The red Italian Lorica strap has a thornbuckle clasp.Ever since its introduction in 2002, the meticulously crafted Invicta Lupah chronograph, Dragon 2096, has become one of the most craved watches in the company\u2019s 150 years of business tradition.Let us kow if you have any questions. We are priced to sell !!!",
