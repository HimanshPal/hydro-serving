  "Description": "This Elgin electronic watch features awesome space age styling as well as a nice quality Swiss made ESA Dynotron 9157 Swissonic electronic balance wheel movement. This movement had a relatively high beat rate of 8 beats per second (28,800 bph), resulting in a smoothly sweeping second hand. Most modern watches have a slower beat rate of 6 beats per second or 21,000 bph. A few run as fast as 10 beats per second or 36,000 bph. Elgin specialized in high beat movements and produced a stopwatch movement at the end of WWII called the \"Jitterbug\" that ran at 40 beats per second or 144,000 bph. Case: Fair This case is in fair condition. It has some visible marks . The case back has a number of small scratches which could probably be brushed out. Overall the case looks like it would polish nicely. Face / Hands: Excellent. The face and hands are in perfect condition. The outer dial has a pearlescent sheen with tiny blue marks around the perimeter and is in perfect shape. The inner dial is a metallic white color with a subtle radial pattern and is again in perfect condition. The red tick marks and hands are in perfect shape with no discoloration or aging.Crystal: Fair The crystal is in fair condition. PLease look at the close up pic of the faceBand / Bracelet: NONEFunction / Accuracy: Unknown The setting crown works well. Did NOT run with new battery installed",
