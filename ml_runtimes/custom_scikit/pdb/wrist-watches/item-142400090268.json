  "Description": "This watch is an extremely rare and highly collectable Railroad Approved dual time calendar model manufactured in 1976. In all of my years of collecting watches, this is only the fourth dual time railroad model I have managed to acquire. It is in superb overall condition, having hardly been worn over the last forty one years. The watch was fully serviced a few weeks ago (April 2017) which included fitting a new battery. This work costs around \u00a3150 or more so do please factor this in when considering the competitive asking price for this watch. In completely original condition, the appearance of this watch is stunning and it is of course running perfectly and keeping great time. This watch is five six times, on the case, dial, two crowns and movement. Please note that replacement batteries are readily available for this watch. You will notice that the watch has two crowns, not one, as with the majority of Accutrons. It also has two hour hands to enable the watch to be set to two time zones, using the upper crown, which is turned to move the hour hand to show the difference between local time and the desired time zone. If you do not wish to see the red hand you can tuck it behind the black hour hand using the upper crown. This watch is an approved railroad watch manufactured to chronometer standards of time accuracy. Before the American railroads began to use computers and electronically controlled time keeping, until around the end of the 1970's, Bulova was one of the major approved railroad watchmakers. The Accutron 214 and 218 Accutron models were so accurate, that they were the obvious choice for the needs of the railroad. The design of the dial is similar to the the American railroad pocket watches used by railway personnel in the late 19th century and the early part of the twentieth century. The movement in this watch is the cal. 2185, only used in dual time models including the 218 version of the highly collectable dual time Astronaut. If you are looking for one of these models you will be hard pressed to find a better example and it may be years before you come across another so if it interests you, do not let this watch pass you by. I have been collecting vintage watches for over twenty five years and selling them as an enjoyable lifestyle occupation since 2003. I have consistently received excellent feedback and many repeat buyers. Customer satisfaction is very important to me so if you do have any problems please get in touch. I will always do my best to help. I often assist customers who ask for my help several years after they have purchased a watch from me; so once you have bought a watch, you will remain an important customer. You can email me at jackanpet123@gmail.com to ask any questions. Please scroll down to see more photographs and details. Case: stainless steel in great condition with the expected light marks from careful use over forty three years but absolutely no signs of abuse, dents or scratches of significance that I could see to draw to your attention. It measures approximately 40 mm from lug to lug and 36 mm across excluding the signed crowns. The outside of the rear cover is marked \" Bulova \" and \"N6\" which signifies the year of manufacture (1976). Dial: original factory finish, in excellent condition, finished in antique white with black Arabic numerals marking the hours and an inner 24 hour track marked by red Arabic numerals. The dial is signed \"Bulova Accutron Railroad Approved Mark IV\". The date aperture is located at 3 o'clock. Movement: cal. 2185 Accutron Tuning Fork movement, running strongly and keeping time. If you hold it to your ear you can hear it humming. The quick set date function operates correctly. The watch was serviced in April 2017. Strap: fitted with a generic black leather strap which fitted to the watch measures approximately 218 mm from buckle tip to last hole.

In order to receive Paypal\u2019s protection service, for which I pay a fee, they require me to send the watch to you with full on line tracking and a signature on delivery.

Terms of Sale I pack my watches very well to avoid damage but very occasionally a problem may occur due to rough treatment in transit or the use of scanning equipment by Customs or the postal services which can magnetise the watch mechanism. I warrant that the watch you purchase will, when you receive it, be as described in the listing. If there is a problem when you receive your purchase I provide a no quibble full refund option. Alternatively I will undertake any repairs that are necessary if the watch is damaged or if in any other way differs significantly from the description. If I have not stated that the watch has been serviced, you may wish to have this work done, particularly if you intend to wear the watch on a daily basis. On request, I can provide you with details of independent watchmakers to whom you can send your watch for servicing. I provide comprehensive details of my watches, including very clear photographs taken with a high resolution macro lens which shows detail not visible to the naked eye. I also invite you to ask questions if there is anything else you need to know. Please take care to consider the dimensions of the watch case as if it is a gentlemans\u2019 Art Deco rectangular vintage watch, they were made significantly smaller than contemporary watches. You are buying a used watch so there will be signs of use. Please do not expect quartz accuracy from a vintage watch. In the 1940\u2019s/1950\u2019s the accepted timekeeping tolerance for a new 17 jewel manual watch was within three minutes a day. All of my watches are professionally inspected and tested before sale and if they are not running smoothly and keeping reasonable time I have them serviced and/ or have any other work undertaken that is needed to ensure the watch is in running condition. However please bear in mind that a fault can develop unexpectedly at any time as with any used item so I am unable to provide any on-going warranty. Please also note that I provide no guarantee that my watches are waterproof. I would always strongly recommend keeping any vintage well away from moisture.
