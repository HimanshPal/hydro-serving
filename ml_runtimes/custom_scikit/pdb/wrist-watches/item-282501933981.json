If you have a problem w/your order, please contact me first before leaving negative feedback. I'll try do everything we can to resolve the issue. Manual Winding the Watch: Unscrew the winding head counter-clockwise from the case. This puts the winding head in position 2. Start winding clockwise by turning the winding head 25 to 30 revolutions. You may need to pull out slightly on the winding head so it doesn't screw back onto the threads. Do not overwind or you will break the mechanism. When done, screw the winding head into position 1. Setting the Time: Unscrew the winding head and pull it out to position 3. You will hear and feel a click. Turn the winding head counter-clockwise to set the correct time. After setting the time, screw the winding head into position 1. Setting the Date: Unscrew the winding head and pull it out to position 3. Set the correct date by turning the watch head counter-clockwise. When done, screw the winding head into position 1. There is a shortcut to changing the date. Unscrew the winding head and pull it out to position 3. Turn the winding head counter-clockwise until the hour hand reaches 12. Then reverse and turn it clockwise until the hour hand reaches 8. Reverse and go back to 12. This will move the date one position. Repeat as necessary. When done, screw the winding head into position 1. NOTE: Never go directly from position 3 (the time-setting position) to position 2 (the winding position). Instead screw down to position 1 then proceed to position 2. So after setting the time or date, screw down the cap then go to position 2 to wind it up. Taking Care of the Watch: Do not lower the watch into water unless the winding head is completely screwed down into position 1. You will feel the rubber gasket seal when it is screwed down completely. To prevent misting under the glass always make sure the winding head is completely screwed down into position 1. Protect the watch from shocks, chemical products and magnetic fields. To prevent penetration of dust and a dirt in the mechanism, never open the back cover of the case.",
