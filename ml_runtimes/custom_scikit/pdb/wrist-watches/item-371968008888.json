  "Description": "You are looking at a new and mint condition silver faced Tag Heuer Link AUTOMATIC WJ201B.BA0591 men's watch. Model WJ201B. This watch is a true survivor. I am a Tag Heuer collector and I own over 225 Tag Heuer watches. I currently have quite a few for sale. It was simply time to clean out the closet. This automatic was obtained from a TAG Heuer dealer and it sat in their case! It is the full size man's tag watch with a case diameter of about 42mm......46mm including the crown. The crystal is in mint condition with zero scratches. The back casing is not only perfect with no visible scratches, but it is see thru as well. The see thru back casing is beautiful since you can see the inner workings of the TAG Heuer Calibre 5 movement. The bracelet is stainless steel and is in near mint condition with a few light scratches from where it rubbed up against the case. These little micro scratches will save you well over $1500! The clasp and surrounding area looks perfect, which can be seen in the pictures. There are some light scratches on the bezel that can be seen under magnification. Once again this watch was never owned, but rather a store model. I would rate this true survivor as a near perfect 9.9 out of 10 in condition. It is beautiful. The stainless band is all original and never sized. It will fit an 8 inch or smaller size wrist. Bezel turns and clicks in the counterclockwise direction, as it should. It has always kept perfect time. It is an automatic movement and 200 meters water resistant. It used to retail for $2895. I would recommend having seals tested before wearing in water as a precaution but it should be perfect. Keeps perfect time. Please see all of my other Tag Heuers for sale too. I have men's and women's tags that are new and used and in all price ranges. I will insure watch for priority mail shipping. SHIPPING IS FREE. The TAG leather display pedestal is not included. Watch comes with the TAG outer box, TAG box, TAG leather case and pillow, TAG manual, TAG leather document holder, TAG retail sticker, and TAG warranty card from Tag Heuer USA retail store. Accessories in excellent condition but the leather on the case and holder is flaking a bit. Remember that others sell their watches as new, mint, etc. Educate yourself! My feedback speaks for itself! I have sold 1000s of Tags and I only sell top shelf Tags that have been well cared for.WJ201B.BA0591 NEW TAG HEUER LINK MEN'S DIVER WATCH - With Manufacturer Serial Numbers - Silver Dial - Self Winding Automatic Movement - Sapphire Crystal Exhibition Case Back - Guaranteed Authentic - Scratch Resistant Sapphire Crystal - Polished Bezel with Brushed Stainless Steel Case & Bracelet - Manufacturer Box & Manual - 200 Meters / 660 Feet Water Resistant - 42mm = 1 5/8\" Case, 8\" Adjustable Bracelet - Deployment Buckle - Luminescent Hands & Markers - Screw Down Crown & Case back All items come from my smoke free and pet free home. trust me as i have a 100% positive feedback rating!!!!
