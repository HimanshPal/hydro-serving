  "Description": "VINTAGE OMEGA SPEEDMASTER AUTOMATIC \u201cMark 4.5\u201dDAY DATE CHRONOGRAPH Year: 1982Omega Ref: 176.0012Omega Calibre: 1045 17 Jewel Automatic Movement42mm Brushed Stainless Steel Case (not including crown)Polished Stainless Steel Pushers and Signed CrownOriginal Black Dial with 3 Sub-Dials Day and DateOriginal Mineral Glass Tachymetre CrystalOriginal Omega 1162/172 Stainless Steel BraceletOriginal Omega Box First introduced as a sport and racing chronograph in 1957, the Speedmaster is perhaps most famous as the first watch worn on the moon - by Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin. However, continuous evolution to keep up with changing fashions and technological advances has ensured the Speedmaster\u2019s iconic status in Omega\u2019s range in each of the six decades since. In 1969 - the same year as Apollo 11 - OMEGA introduced the first \u201cMark-series\u201d Speedmaster with the radically re-styled Mark II. The chunky, futuristic, Mark III followed in 1971 and in 1973 the Mark IV used the same dial and calibre 1040 movement in a more conservative, streamlined, case. The most complex and long-serving \u201cMark-series\u201d model was launched in 1974 and stayed in production until 1985. Nicknamed the \u201cMark 4.5\u201d by aficionados, it was officially known only as Speedmaster Automatic Ref.176.0012 and featured three sub-dials, seven hands, day and date. Power came from Omega\u2019s calibre 1045 automatic movement - a rebranded version of the now legendary and highly collectable Lemania 5100. From my own collection, this superb all-original Omega Speedmaster Automatic \u201cMark 4.5\u201d Chronograph dates from 1982 and is in exceptional condition. The \u201csunburst\u201d brushed stainless steel case and bracelet are virtually unmarked. The original dial, hand set and day/date rings are all beautifully preserved with a subtle, even, patina. The original tachymetre crystal has no scratches and only a couple of tiny chips visible under magnification (at the edge by the \u201c85\u201d tachymetre marking and polished smooth). All functions work correctly with excellent day, date and chronograph reset alignment. The calibre 1045 automatic movement has been recently lubricated and adjusted. Power reserve and time-keeping are both superb. Overall, this is the best \u201cMark 4.5\u201d I have seen and - like all \u201cmark-series\u201d Speedmasters - is a vintage watch you can confidently wear every day. PayPal only. Please only buy/offer if you intend to make immediate PayPal payment. No returns accepted. This is a well maintained Swiss watch but, due to it's age, I cannot guarantee its accuracy or water resistance. It is 'sold as seen' so please read the description and study the photographs carefully. If in doubt, please ask - I will be happy to answer any questions.",
