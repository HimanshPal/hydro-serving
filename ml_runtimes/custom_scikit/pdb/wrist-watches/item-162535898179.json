  "Description": "Case size approx 52mm (measure accross bezel), or 56mm including the crown screwed down. NEW WITH TAGS, CASE, AND MANUAL. Invicta Reserve 52mm Thunderbolt Quartz Chronograph Stainless Steel Bracelet Watch Gold tone with Silver Tone accents The Reserve Thunderbolt sets its own standard and then goes even further with a round gold-tone stainless steel case and unidirectional rotating bezel. You'll probably think of the regular Bolt with the cable wire along the bezel \u2013 only this one's bigger and thicker at 3mm \u2013 while a large crown winds between function pushers (they're large, too). An exhibition case back reveals your movement and a wide bracelet secures it. The cable character continues on the dial as it trims the subdials. Coordinated but still cool, you'll find them in 60-seconds, 30-minute and day of the week formats as a date window lands near 4:00. Luminous accents brighten the hands as they guide you through your day, passing \"Invicta Reserve\" below 12:00. Details: Movement: Swiss Movement Ronda Z60 Quartz Chronograph Movement Country of Origin: Switzerland Case Measurements: 52mm Case Thickness: 22-1/2mm Crystal: Flame Fusion Crown: Screw Down w/ Function Pushers Bracelet: Stainless Steel Bracelet Measurements: 9\" L x 29mm W Clasp: Deployant Water Resistance: 50 ATM - 500 meters - 1650 feet Weight: 13.25 oz Watch Country of Origin: Final assembly changed to China, effective 9-1-2016 Model 21345 With its most inspired creations yet, Invicta demonstrates its technical and design prowess, offering timepieces of style for extreme value. \"We have long held firm to the belief that supremely crafted timepieces can be offered for extremely modest sums.
