A very hard to find watch now running very keeping time but no seconds hands and lose crown in could be a easy fix was going to go off one day to be fixed but my old watch man has stopped working now so all my old Bulovas that need any work and going up for sale as you know do they are top end watches .The watch looks very cool as it has that cool design case and dial. I love the way the hands and markers are on this watch just so nice by the way .Some sizes for you 36mm case,39mm with logo crown ,40mm lug to lug,12.77mm thick.(Please see condition report just a few marks on clasp and bracelet still a very nice one of these and a rare find now for sure there is one on here for sale not as nice as this imho by a long way and that's \u00a3430 +p&p .)This is one for the collectors i think it's a nice design as well.see photos.
