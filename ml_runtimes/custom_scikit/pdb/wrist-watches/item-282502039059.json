The Burlington GS90061/04 Rotary watch features a black genuine leather textured strap and contrasting rose gold plated detailing. The rose gold plated casing houses the jet back round dial which has batons marking each hour and a date window at three o\u2019clock. This automatic watch is powered by movement so never requires a battery. The elegant slim second\u2019s hand sweeps around the dial which is finished with domed glass completing the vintage styling of the Les Originales collection. With a skeleton dial to the back of the watch, the intricate automatic mechanism, which contains 21 jewels can be seen working. This Rotary watch comes complete with a lifetime manufacturer\u2019s warranty which covers the internal working parts. To maintain this warranty the watch is required to be serviced every 3 years ensuring it is kept at its best working condition.
