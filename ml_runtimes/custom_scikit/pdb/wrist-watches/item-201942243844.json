  "Description": "Untitled Document 40s Vintage GRUEN Curvex 440 17J WATCH SWISS MEN 10K GOLD FILLED CURVED I am pleased to offer this fantastic and original GRUEN dress watch for men from the mid 40s of their Curvex series. The Curvex series is an extremely sought after series as it is the only one in full production scale of actual curved mechanical movements. Working well and keeping good time, ready to wear or add to your collection! Movement: State of the art GRUEN Swiss manual wind movement. This is fine 440 Curvex caliber, running well on 17 jewels. The movement is working well and clean, keeping good time. Case, Crystal & Crown: 100% Original and signed GRUEN 10K gold filled case in great shape, nicely curved and with very good overall condition. With good crown and mint crystal. Dial & Hands : Professionally restored and correct pearl tone dial with raised gold plated numerals/markers and original set of hands. Tip for collectors: Despite popular demand for refinished clean dials, I am aware of collectors' search and sensitivity for original dials. Therefore any dials known to be refinished, will be clearly mentioned in the dial section of the description. Otherwise, dial is believed to be 100% original. Size: Measures 24 mm side to side (excluding crown) and 33 mm lug to lug. Vintage watches are often smaller than watches common nowadays; To avoid inconvenience, Please take a moment to examine the size and make sure it meets your expectations and wrist size. Band: Equipped with a quality brand new TIMEPIECE padded genuine leather band in black, 16 mm wide. The band/bracelet shown in the images is the exact one that will come with your watch. However please remember I sell the watch, not the band. Please consider it as a gift for your watch, it is not a part of the auction. Please keep in mind that due to the nature of these mechanical watches and their early age, although I fully stand behind my description, I can't guarantee perfect time accuracy. Photos are considered a part of the description. Shipping and handling - Worldwide flat rate: DHL Express door-to-door - 35.00 $US Expected delivery in 3 business days. Tracking available online. This is a signed for and fully insured express service. Once payment is made, I will send a confirmation email with expected date of shipping. I ship in 48 hours from clearance of funds, or earlier. Payments for items: Payments are strictly expected within 5 days of end of auction, unless a prior arrangement is agreed upon. Please be advised that I often sell for other people and need to pay them according to the final bid; I therefore expect the payment to be made in a timely manner and reserve the right to relist items that are not paid within 5 days of end of auction, without prior notice. My preffered method of payment is .
