  "Description": "You are looking at a Tag Heuer Aquaracer WAF1412.BA0823 women's watch. The silver dial is stunning. I own over 225 tag heuer watches (and I currently have quite a few for sale). It was simply time to clean out the closet. I am a tag heuer collector. The crystal is in mint condition. Perfect crystal with no scratches. The case diameter is 27mm....30mm if you count the crown. The back casing is in good condition with a typical wear scratches. The bracelet is stainless steel and it is in excellent condition with some light scratches. There are also light scratches & desk rash on the clasp. There are some fine scratches on the bezel. I would rate this TAG as a 9.2 out of 10 in condition. It is beautiful. The crystal being scratch free is the most important thing. Bezel turns nice and crisply in counter clockwise direction as it should. All of the numbers are still perfectly blackened around the bezel. It keeps perfect time. It is quartz movement and 300 meters water resistant. It was sized at the jeweler and it will currently fit a size 7 inch wrist or smaller. In fact, if you need extra links I would be willing to sell you some at $25 per link. I have access to them from a local jewelry store. If you want the extra links just let me know immediately after purchase so I can invoice you for them. It also has the rare wetsuit extension so larger size wrists can wear it if you choose to open it up. This watch is selling for $1900 new. The serial numbers are engraved on the back of the watch(but they are a bit faint due to a buff). This is 100% authentic. Why pay $1900 for a brand new tag when you can buy this one for much less? Please see my other tag heuers for sale too!!!! I will insure watch for priority mail shipping. SHIPPING IS FREE WITH BUY IT NOW. The TAG leather display is not included in the auction for this watch. Watch comes with the original TAG Heuer box, TAG leather case & pillow, TAG manual, & TAG warranty card. Accessories are in excellent condition.
