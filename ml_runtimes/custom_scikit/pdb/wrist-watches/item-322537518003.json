  "Description": "Very nice watch, no scuffs or scratches that I can see. Face is bordered by pink gems. Pearlescent face with gold or gold tone numerals. Very beautiful to be sure. Please Note: The majority of our listings come from estate sales so the previous environmental situations are not known and they will need a detailed cleaning. Please study all photos to make sure that this item is right for you and that you agree with its condition. We handle many things that we do not know a lot about so the pictures are the most accurate description. If you have any questions or need more or better pictures, please ask. I will respond ASAP. Shipping: We always try to ship USPS Priority Mail because it is insured and fast, but in some cases offer other shipping services, so check out the other shipping options. If priority mail is not good for you, just ask for whatever you have in mind prior to purchase or bid. Please be sure that the address you have on file with Paypal and Ebay are correct: this is the address I will ship to - No Exceptions. Returns: Always excepted unless stated otherwise in the description. Thanks for looking!",
