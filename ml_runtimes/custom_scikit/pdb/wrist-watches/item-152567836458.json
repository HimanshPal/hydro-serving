  "Description": "You are looking at a Tag Heuer Aquaracer Calibre S Chronograph CAF7011.BA0821 men's watch. This watch does not disappoint. The silver dial is stunning. I own over 225 tag heuer watches (and I currently have quite a few for sale). It was simply time to clean out the closet. I am a Tag Heuer collector. The diameter across the face is 44mm........48mm including the crown. The crystal is in mint condition with no scratches. The back casing is excellent and has light wear scratches. The bracelet is stainless steel and it is in very good to excellent condition with light wear scratches. There are also light scratches (desk rash) on the clasp. The bezel is beautiful with some fine scratches. The silver dial with the chronograph sub-dials is stunning. You get so many compliments on it. Photos do not do it justice. I would rate this TAG as a 9.2 out of 10 in condition. It is beautiful. You can always have the ss buffed and it would look new. Bezel turns nice and crisply in the counter clockwise direction, as it should. It keeps perfect time. It is the TAG Heuer hybrid electro-mechanical Calibre S movement and 300 meters water resistant. The chrono function works perfectly on the watch. It starts, stops, and resets to zero as it should. It has a perpetual calendar until 2099 and it keeps date and time too. It is a sophisticated process to set the watch so I will include the handy manual, which walks you thru that. It will currently fit a large size 7.85 inch wrist or smaller. In fact, if you need extra links I would be willing to sell you some at $20 per link or $15 each for two or more links. I have access to them from a local jewelry store. If you want the extra links just let me know immediately after purchase so I can invoice you for them. It also has the rare wetsuit extension so larger size wrists can wear it if you choose to open it up. This watch is selling for $3000 new and I am giving you a great discount. The serial numbers are engraved on the back of the watch! This is 100% authentic. Why pay $3000 for a brand new tag when you can buy this new one for much less? Please see my other tag heuers for sale too!!!! I will insure watch for priority mail shipping. SHIPPING IS FREE WITH BUY IT NOW. The Tag leather display is not included in the auction. Watch comes with the TAG Heuer box, TAG leather case, TAG leather document holder, TAG Calibre S manual, TAG warranty registration, & TAG kwarrantycard. Accessories in excellent condition.
