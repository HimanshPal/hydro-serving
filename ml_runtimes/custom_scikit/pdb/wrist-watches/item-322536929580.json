  "Description": "A nice, rare Rolex Tudor Prince Oysterdate XL men's watch in the \"Ranger II\" design. Tudor Ref. 9111/0. Serial dated to 1979. I am the second owner of this watch, bought from the original owner who purchased it new from an AD in 1980 or 1981. Excellent condition with minor cosmetic wear-- completely untouched original except for movement service! This is the big men's size with rare combo of engine-turned bezel and blue bullseye dial. Full set with inner/outer boxes, hang tag, and blank warranty papers. Full details below! Dial: Original blue \"bull's eye\" type with\u00a0 applied Tudor Shield logo, silver stick markers, date at 3, silver lumed wide stick hands and sweep seconds. No patina. All original trit lume plots in place. Mint condition and fully signed Tudor Prince Oysterdate, Rotor Self-Winding, Swiss. Never refinished Case: Original, unpolished, solid steel Rolex-made Oyster case with Engine-Turned bezel. Case numbers are crisp and legible. Typical overall wear commensurate with age; has a small dent at bottom of the left case side. \"...By Rolex\" caseback with proper signing in and out. See pics. XL size 38mm without crown! Crown: Original, proper Rolex Twinlock crown, screws down securely. Crystal: Original acrylic with cyclope magnifier. Clear (buffed). Movement: Tudor (Rolex modified ETA) Swiss automatic with 25 jewels and quickset date. Rotor signed Tudor Auto-Prince. Very clean, 98% Rhodium finish. Runs strongly and keeps great time, date snaps over at midnight. Rotor winds smoothly with zero vertical play. Obviously well maintained over its lifetime. Previous owner claims his last service was around 2001 but I have no proof of that so take the info as you will. Now, I personally had this watch serviced October 2016 by my Rolex-certified master watchmaker and will include the receipt of same. Please note, as with anything vintage accuracy not guaranteed, regular service recommended.\u00a0 Box & Papers: Inner and outer boxes, genuine, red, signed with gold Tudor shield logos etc. Soft grey interior. Original red hang tag. Original Tudor translation Warranty book, which is blank and unused. Strap: Original steel 22mm Rolex-made integrated bracelet Ref. 7587, with all its original links. Some stretch, nothing major and better than most I have seen. Clasp is Rolex signed, with Tudor Shield on the outer. Fully adjustable, will fit most. Typical age wear, please see pics. Bracelet, like the case, has never been restored or polished. An extremely scarce watch with original untouched blue variant bull's eye dial. 100% original & genuine. Please see pics, they are the best description of condition and show exactly the item you will receive. I ship worldwide with very few exceptions-- to those areas where secure, insured and signed-for delivery is not possible. I will not ship without signature etc, please don't ask - this is for your protection as well as mine. Any customs fees or delays are imposed by your government and I am not responsible for them. Thanks for looking! EDIT note (mostly for eBay staff): eBay removed this listing for \"incorrect brand name use\" in the title... It is commonly known fact that Tudor is a Rolex brand, like Cadillac or Chevrolet is a brand of GM. All Tudor from c1930 to the 2010s were manufactured by Rolex in-house, using all Rolex parts except the movements (which even then were still modified and tweaked by Rolex). The official advertising and documentation over all the decades, refer to the brand as \"Tudor by Rolex\" and the cases, crowns, bracelets etc are literally signed with the Rolex name/logo. Despite this, and despite selling many vintage Tudors quite correctly as \"by Rolex\" here with no problem over the years, I am apparently all of a sudden not allowed to use the word \"Rolex\" along with \"Tudor\". As I have now edited the title, hopefully that will satisfy the powers that be and this listing will stay up.",
