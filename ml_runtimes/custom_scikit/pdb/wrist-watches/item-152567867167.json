As perhaps never before, young people of the day saw no limits to their aspirations. Seiko 5 needed to be a watch that could go anywhere and everywhere. The first challenge was durability. To be durable, a watch needs to be impervious to two threats; water and shock. Water resistance was built in as standard to every Seiko 5 watch, and metal bracelets were used so that, from buckle to buckle, the watch was resistant to water and sweat. Shock resistance was assured with two Seiko inventions. First, the mainspring was made from \u201cDiaflex,\u201d an unbreakable alloy, and the \u201cDiashock,\u201d system was created to protect the movement from shock within the case. Legibility was the next vital attribute. Today, we take for granted that day and date are presented in a single window but, in fact, this was an idea built in to Seiko 5 to enhance the legibility of the dial. The genius was to create a unique system that allowed both day and date to be shown in one plane. The final challenge was to create a distinctive look that defined the brand. Thanks to the extraordinary Seiko invention of the \u2018Magic Lever,\u2019 the winding efficiency of Seiko 5 is very high, and the wearer rarely needs to use the crown. So the designers made it smaller and hid it under the lip of the case at 4 o\u2019clock, giving Seiko 5 its signature look. \u00a0 Specification PAYMENT SHIPPING & PACKAGE RETURNS FEEDBACK Brand Seiko MPN SRP750K1 UPC 3866488426223 Movement Automatic Self-Winding Water Resistance Rating 100 m (10 ATM) Watch Shape Round Case Material Stainless Steel Case Colour Gold Face Colour Black Band Material Rubber Band Colour Black Case Size 44mm Gender Men Paypal or Bank Deposit (Please write your eBay ID in the reference) for Australia buyers.
