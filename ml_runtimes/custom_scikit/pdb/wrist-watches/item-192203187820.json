Displaying hours, minutes and seconds via central hands, the date is displayed in an aperture at the 8.30 mark. The smoky dial provides a glimpse into the inner workings of the timepiece and features white Arabic numerals with Super LumiNova central hands and a yellow seconds hand for excellent legibility. The chronograph function features 30-minute and 60-second accumulators at 3 and 6 o\u2019clock positions respectively, each with yellow hands. For ultimate precision a fast action start/stop trigger with Clous de Paris grip is placed over the crown. A domed double-sided anti-reflective sapphire crystal protects the watchface and ensures a clear view of the time, at all times. The automatic mechanical movement with 25 jewels lies inside a black carbon case and bezel. An intriguing view of the mechanism is provided by the sapphire crystal case-back as well as an adventurous 100m water resistance. The 47mm case is mounted onto a brown bomber-jacket leather strap that is secured on the wrist with a tang buckle.Please note that some watches are on memo from other dealers and do not carry a return policy, you will be notified before your purchase if the selected watch meets this criteria.
