  "Description": "Hello, I'm selling this vintage and hard to find Seiko analogic and digital watch in working condition as you can see in the images. All functions are working 100%. This watch is quite peculiar and was constructed in a very interesting and different way from the other watches of this genre, for example, the crown of this watch is used to set the analog time and also the digital time. The watch is in good cosmetic condition for the age, just some wear marks on case and strap but nothing major in my opinion. The watch case and strap has a very distinctive gold tone. Please see the images below and if you have any additional question contact me. This is a private sale so returns are not accepted. I will ship worldwide. This item will be shipped by registered air mail with tracking number. Thank you",
