  "Description": "Vintage Women's Watch, I bought it somewhere around 1998 and paid somewhere around 300.00 Two Tone Band, Yellow Dial that glows in the dark. Date Window, Quartz Battery and Japan movement. Sports 50 is a scarce model, very hard to find and VERY good quality. Seiko designed the Sports 50 watches to indicate that they were water resistant to a depth of 50 meters. Size - 25 mm wide x 31 mm lug to lug* Working Condition. Sets, Runs, Keeps Time, it does need the battery replaced. Serial number 873226 Currently fits 7 to 7 1/4 wrist I had them add links because my wrists are big. Watch model: 7N82-0261 [A4] This is a vintage item, it will have signs of being pre-owned. Please look at all the photos, they are part of the description. It still has plenty of style and is keeping accurate time. If you have any questions please let me know. Check out my other items for sale. Thank you and have a GREAT day!!!",
