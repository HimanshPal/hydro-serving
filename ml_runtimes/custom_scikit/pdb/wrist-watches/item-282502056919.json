  "Description": "chapelle_jewellery Visit our eBay Shop Add us to your Favourites list > Subscribe to our Newsletter > About Chapelle Delivery The Chapelle Guarantee Mens Kahuna red canvas watch KUS-0114G RRP \u00a335.00 Now \u00a319.99 Description The contrasting sections of this watch are very eye catching, with a bright red strap and dark black contrasting sections. The strap is made from a light canvas material, which is secured with a dark stainless steel buckle clasp. As this strap is made from canvas, it is comfortable and easy to wear. The dial is quite a statement piece, as the large 47 mm width and large rotating bezel are striking. The background of the dial is the same bright red as the strap, however the dots and batons are black, and as are the hour, minute and second hands. The bezel has a similar colour combination, however the base in black whilst the numbers are a metallic red. However, there is one exception with a magnified date window in place of the number \u2018three\u2019, which is easily seen and recognised. Kahuna have designed this watch so that it is 50 metres water resistant, which makes it easy (along with the washable fabric strap) to wash the dishes etc;.
