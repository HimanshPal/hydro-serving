  "Description": "PLEASE CLICK HERE TO SEE FULL ITEM DESCRIPTION DescriptionALL TIMEPIECES ARE GUARANTEED AUTHENTIC \u00a0 Series: Speedmaster Day/Date Automatic Chronograph Model #: 3523.30 Version: Men's / Gents Case: Stainless steel Band: Stainless steel Dial: Silver Crystal: Sapphire Movement: Automatic.\u00a0 Self-winding movement never requires a battery. Case size: 39MM (diagonally) or 41MM (horizontally, including crown) Total circumference: 7.5\" Condition: Could almost pass for a brand new watch. Sapphire crystal is flawless. Dial/hands are perfect. Bezel shines like new. Bracelet shows no wear and retains original brushed/polished finishes. You would have to look to obscure parts of the watch like the inner bracelet clasp and the caseback to find any evidence of wear at all. All functions have been tested and work perfectly. This is the significantly nicer day/date model, with perimeter date, day and month as well as 24 hour feature. This is also the newer model, with more robust bracelet design, along with a few other minor updates (modern crown design, etc.).\u00a0 \u00a0 Click here to view the WRISTWATCHTRADER EBAY STORE \u00a0 Sizing: Occasionally good fortune will shine upon us and the timepiece will fit perfectly upon arrival. \u00a0However, for the majority of cases we will need to add/remove links for desired fit. \u00a0For more info about how to obtain expansion links, please do not hesitate to contact me and I'll be happy to help.
