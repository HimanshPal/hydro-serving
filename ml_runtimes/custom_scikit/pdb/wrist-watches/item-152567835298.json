  "Description": "You are looking at an excellent Tag Heuer Alter Ego WP1312 women's watch. This watch does not disappoint. The dial is stunning. The color is hard to describe but it is some sort of blueish / purplish mother of pearl. I own over 225 tag heuer watches (and I currently have quite a few for sale). It was simply time to clean out the closet. I am a TAG Heuer collector. The crystal is in mint condition. The back casing is very nice with some typical light scratches. The bracelet is stainless steel and it is in excellent condition with only a few light scratches. The watch was only worn 5x and it looks great! I would rate this TAG as a 9.5 out of 10 in condition. It is beautiful. It was barely worn. A buff of the SS would make it look new, but it is not necessary. It keeps perfect time. It is quartz movement and 100 meters water resistant. It will currently fit a size 6.75 inch wrist or smaller. In fact, if you need extra links I would be willing to sell you some at $25 per link. I have access to them from a local jewelry store. If you want the extra links just let me know immediately after purchase so I can invoice you for them. This watch was selling for $1500 new and I am giving you a great discount. This is 100% authentic. Why pay $1500 for a brand new tag when you can buy this new one for much less? Please see my other tag heuers for sale too!!!! I will insure watch for priority mail shipping. SHIPPING IS FREE WITH BUY IT NOW. The Tag leather display is not included in the auction. Watch comes with the TAG Heuer travel box & TAG warranty card. Box is in good condition with a few bends and rips.

I AM CLEARING OUT MY HUGE COLLECTION. LOOK AT MY FEEDBACK. IT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF! I AM ONLY SELLING MINT CONDITION ITEMS. DO NOT TRUST THESE OTHER EBAYERS SELLING USED AND BEAT UP WATCHES.

Shipping is $45 to most international destinations including Canada and the UK. However there are a few countries in which shipping will be higher. Australia, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries will cost more. Contact me BEFORE PURCHASING IF FROM AN INTERNATIONAL COUNTRY SO I CAN VERIFY SHIPPING COSTS.
