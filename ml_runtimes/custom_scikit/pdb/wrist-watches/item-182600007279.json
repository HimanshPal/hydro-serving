The silver dial with a white <<Guilloche>> pattern in the center of it, superimposed stainless steel hour markers & Arabic numerals, orange motives that represents the rev counters between 12 and 3 o'clock, BMW roundel at 12 o'clock and date in window at 3 o'clock, will make this elegant yet sporty timepiece, an eye catcher. Luminous hands, hour markers and Arabic numerals. The snap-on stainless steel back that has the BMW roundel laser engraved on it, makes the watch water resistant to 3 ATM. A superb designed classic brown fine leather band, secures the watch on your wrist with a stainless steel buckle.Guilloch\u00e8 (presumably named after a French engineer - Guillot - who invented a turning machine in the 18th century) is a decorative technique in which a repetitive pattern is engraved into an underlying material using a mechanical engine-turning table, also called a rose engine lathe. The Guilloch\u00e9 pattern gives the dial a lot of life. The guilloche dial with the engraved pattern is razor sharp. For each difference in angle and light the dial changes in infinity!
