  "Description": "You are looking at an excellent condition black & silver faced Tag Heuer 2000 Professional Classic Chronograph CK1110 men's watch. Model CK1110.BA0311. This watch is a true survivor. I am a Tag Heuer collector and I own over 225 Tag Heuer watches. I currently have quite a few for sale. It was simply time to clean out the closet. It is the full size tag watch with a face diameter of about 39mm (42mm including the crown). The crystal is in mint condition with zero scratches. There is a small piece of lume or lint under the glass that you can have blown out the next time you have it serviced. The back casing is in excellent condition with a few light scratches. The bracelet is stainless steel and is in very good condition with light scratches. The clasp and surrounding area has the same light scratching and desk rash, which can be seen in the pictures. The bezel is in very good condition with all of the numbers still blackened out & light scratches. I would rate this true survivor as a solid 9.1 out of 10 in condition. It is beautiful. New battery just installed and serviced by Tag Heuer dealer. The stainless band is all original and will fit a 7.2 inch or smaller size wrist snuggly. If you happen to need extra links I would be willing to sell you some at $20 per link or $15 each for 2 or more. I have access to them from a local jewelry store. If you want the extra links just let me know immediately after purchase so I can invoice you for them. Bezel turns and clicks in the counter clockwise direction, as it should. It has always kept perfect time. The chronograph works perfectly. It starts and stops just like it should. The hands and sub-dials all run and reset to zero as they should. It is quartz movement and 200 meters water resistant. It used to retail for $1995. I would recommend having seals tested before wearing in water as a precaution. Keeps perfect time. Please see all of my other Tag Heuers for sale too. I have men's and women's tags that are new and used and in all price ranges. I will insure watch for priority mail shipping. SHIPPING IS FREE. The TAG leather display pedestal is not included. Watch comes with the Tag manual & TAG warranty card.Remember that others sell their watches as new, mint, etc. Educate yourself! My feedback speaks for itself! I have sold 1000s of Tags and I only sell top shelf Tags that have been well cared for.TAG HEUER2000 SERIESCK1110 CK1110.BA0311 TAG HEUER CLASSIC 2000 MENS LUXURY WATCH - WITH MANUFACTURER SERIAL NUMBERS - Black Dial with Silver Subdials - Battery Operated Quartz Movement - Guaranteed Authentic - Scratch Resistant Sapphire Crystal - Brushed Steel Case & Bracelet - 200 Meters / 660 Feet Water Resistant - 39mm = 1 1/2\" Case, 7.2\" Adjustable Bracelet - Deployment Buckle - Luminescent Hands & Markers - Screw Down Crown & Case back All items come from my smoke free and pet free home. trust me as i have a 100% positive feedback rating!!!!
