The watch making industry already existed in the country during that period. It was said that the German military had more stringent standards than the British, and their watches produced with better design and finishing. German military watches were supplied by many renowned watchmakers with A. Lange & Sohne leading the list. Unfortunately, German military watches from WWII period that are still existing today are extremely rare, compared to those of the U.S and U.K. This is probably due to a European movement to destroy everything related to the Nazis at that time.
