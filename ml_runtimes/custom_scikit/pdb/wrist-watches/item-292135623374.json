  "Description": "I have a ladies diamond set Bunz wristwatch for sale. It is very simple and classy and has diamonds round the face and a diamond in the center of the dial. It is stainless steel and the face is a silvery colour. It is pre-owned but in very good condition although I would think it would need a new strap soon. I like the strap as it is because it is nice and soft to wear but do appreciate that might not be the top criteria for everyone but a new strap would not be expensive if you were happy to buy a generic one from a jeweller. I have added a photo of a ring because I wanted to take advantage of the ebay listing offer but will add photos of the watch tomorrow (24 November) so please wait to see the correct photos before buying.",
