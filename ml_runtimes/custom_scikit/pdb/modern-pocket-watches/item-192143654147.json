  "Description": "This is quite possibly the best Movado Pocket watch I have ever seen. I believe the serial number dates it to 1916. It is 252138 on the case. The two tone 18K case is rows of white and yellow gold, which are solid as you can see inside and outside. The enamel is all there. The roman numerals on the dial are set with Rose cut diamonds. The Numerals themselves appear to be platinum. This watch winds up and runs perfectly smooth. The 18K white gold watch chain has small seed pearls and goes perfectly with this fine time piece. The crystal is nice , probably an 8 out of 10, with some very faint tiny scratches. You can only see those if you tilt back and forth in bright light. The yellowing on the movement appears to be paint bleed from the hand etched words there. It actually is nicer in person than in the pictures.
