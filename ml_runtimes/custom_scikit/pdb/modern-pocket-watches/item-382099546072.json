Thank you for viewing our products! We strive for excellent service and products, and positive feedback. If there is ever any problem with your transaction, we require you to contact us before opening a case or leaving negative feedback. We appreciate having the opportunity to rectify any problems with our items or listings and so far we always have. In these situations with no communication from the buyer, all negative feedbacks will be reviewed by eBay for removal.****An unpaid item case is automatically opened after one week of non-payment. If there are any issues with paying, please communicate with us before then so we can cancel instead of getting a negative mark on your account.****Please have any alternate shipping locations or instructions available before payment. This allows us to provide very quick, if not same day shipping if payment is made before 4:15pm EST. This is to keep you and eBay happy with our performance. If your payment is made between 4:15 pm Friday and 4:15 pm (EST) Monday, your item will ship Monday. Thank you.****Signature confirmation MAY or MAY NOT be automatically added to any item over $200 in value at our discretion and you will NOT receive a separate notice of this. If having or not having this feature is important to your situation, it is completely on you the buyer to communicate that with us before payment (so we can invoice you correctly) for any item, value, or reason. It is always free for items over $100. Please keep a couple things in mind. 1. If the tracking number on ANY item shows delivery to your provided address, there is nothing more we can do. 2. Be aware of mail theft and the target victims. Upscale homes and neighborhoods are the optimal targets for this type of crime but nobody is exempt or immune to this crime.****Please leave brand new items in the exact condition as they were received if you would like to be refunded the full cash value. Occasionally a brand new item that is sealed and a new/other item that is opened but still not touched have a significant difference in value and you are subject to paying that difference and/or restocking fee if you open a brand new item. Ensuring the item is the exact thing you need is on you, the customer, before purchasing a brand new item. We can NOT lose money and/or item condition to help you see if you like something or if it fits etc. Thanks again",
