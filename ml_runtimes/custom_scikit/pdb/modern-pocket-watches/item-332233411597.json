  "Description": "Elgin (U.S.) Columbia Model 12-Size Open Face 15-Jewel Pocket Watch U.S.; Man\u2019s; Serial # 26,120,202; CA1924 CASE: The 12-size (40-44MM) yellow gold plated open face place is plain with micro beaded edge. DIAL: This white porcelain single sunk dial features Arabic numerals and spade hands. MOVT: The 15-jewel stem-set nickel movement has a lever escapement and a \u00be-plate layout. COND: C 3-9-12 (The case is in very good condition, slightly scratched, a small dent) D 3-45-53 (The dial is in very good condition, multiple hairlines, very slightly chipped) M 3-7 (The movement is in very good condition, slightly oxidized) AI-SP12016-8 Jewel Count Jewels are used as bearings to reduce metal-to-metal contacts which produce friction and wear. They improve the performance and accuracy of the watch and materially proglong its usefulness. The materials used for making watch jewels are diamonds, sapphires, rubies and garnets. The diamond is the hardest but is seldom used except for cap jewels. The sapphire is the next hardness and is the most commonly used because of its fine texture. Garnets are softer than than sapphires and rubies. Lever Escapement An escapement is a device in mechanical watches and clocks that transfers energy to the timekeeping element (the \"impulse action\") and allows the number of its oscillations to be counted (the \"locking action\"). The impulse action transfers energy to the clock's timekeeping element (usually a pendulum or balance wheel) to replace the energy lost to friction during its cycle and keep the timekeeper oscillating. The escapement is driven by force from a coiled spring or a suspended weight, transmitted through the timepiece's gear train. Each swing of the pendulum or balance wheel releases a tooth of the escapement's escape wheel gear, allowing the clock's gear train to advance or \"escape\" by a fixed amount. This regular periodic advancement moves the clock's hands forward at a steady rate. At the same time the tooth gives the timekeeping element a push, before another tooth catches on the escapement's pallet, returning the escapement to its \"locked\" state. The sudden stopping of the escapement's tooth is what generates the characteristic \"ticking\" sound heard in operating mechanical clocks and watches. 3/4 Plate Layout The 3/4 plate and the balance cock are flush and about 1/4 of a full plate is cut out to allow for the balance, thus the 3/4 plate.
