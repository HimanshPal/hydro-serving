  "Description": "Up for auction is a really nice rail road pocket watch with leather case. This one is made by Wrangler. It is an open face watch that fits nicely into a custom made leather cover that has a loop for your belt to go through so you can wear it on your waist. Color is silver. Really nicely done etching on the back of the watch depicting leaves (look to me to be maple) in the center surrounded by heavily detailed scrolling. Watch and case are in great condition. Size is 1 7/8 in diameter and 2 1/2 inches tall from the bottom to the top of the clasp. Once you install a new battery the watch will be fully functional and keep great time. If you are in the market for a really nice rail road pocket watch at a steal of a price then you can't pass this one up.",
