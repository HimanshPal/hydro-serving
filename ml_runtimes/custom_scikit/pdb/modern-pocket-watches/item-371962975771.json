  "Description": "Click Any Image to Enlarge Description The Hamilton Watch Company was established in 1892 with the sale of the bankrupt Keystone Standard Watch Company (previously known as the Lancaster Watch Company) to a group of Lancaster businessmen. During this same year, they also mergered with the Aurora Watch Company of Illinois. After the mergers, they decided to name the new company after James Hamilton, owner of a large tract of land which was granted to him from William Penn and included what is now the city of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Hamilton produced some of the premiere Railroad Pocket Watches of their time. The first model, Broadway Limited, was know as \"The Watch of Railroad Accuracy\". This slogan would follow the Hamilton Watch Company through decades. This Original and Untouched Hamilton 950 truly displays the quality of the Hamilton Watch Company. This gem has a 14 Karat Yellow Gold, Double Hinged Case with a Glass Crystal. The inside case back is marked Keystone, 14K 5637383. It is further marked Guaranteed 14K, 585 Fine, The K.W.C.Co, 5637383 on the inside dust cover. The elegance of the Hamilton watch is not only in its styling, but in its craftmanship as well.
