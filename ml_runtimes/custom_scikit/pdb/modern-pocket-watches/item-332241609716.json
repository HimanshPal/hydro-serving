  "Description": "Hamilton 12-Size Grade 912 Yellow Gold-Filled Pocket Watch Hamilton; U.S.; Man\u2019s; Serial #3,372,529; Circa 1928 CASE: The yellow gold-filled 12-size (40-44MM) open face case is plain. DIAL: This silver metal dial displays Arabic numerals and Cathedral hands. MOVT: The 17-jewel stem-set nickel movement has a lever escapement, \u00be-plate layout and is signed. CONDITIONS: C 3 (Case is in Very Good Condition) D 3-15 (Dial is in Very Good Condition \u2013 spotted) M 3 (Movement is in Very Good Condition) AI-SP72016-1 Stem Wind/Stem Set Movement Stem-wind, stem-set movements did away with the watch key which was a necessity for the operation of any pocket watch up to that point. The crown of the watch is pulled out a short distance allowing the hands to be turned to set the watch. The crown is pressed back into place and is turned to wind the watch. Lever Escapement An escapement is a device in mechanical watches and clocks that transfers energy to the timekeeping element (the \"impulse action\") and allows the number of its oscillations to be counted (the \"locking action\"). The impulse action transfers energy to the clock's timekeeping element (usually a pendulum or balance wheel) to replace the energy lost to friction during its cycle and keep the timekeeper oscillating. The escapement is driven by force from a coiled spring or a suspended weight, transmitted through the timepiece's gear train. Each swing of the pendulum or balance wheel releases a tooth of the escapement's escape wheel gear, allowing the clock's gear train to advance or \"escape\" by a fixed amount. This regular periodic advancement moves the clock's hands forward at a steady rate. At the same time the tooth gives the timekeeping element a push, before another tooth catches on the escapement's pallet, returning the escapement to its \"locked\" state. The sudden stopping of the escapement's tooth is what generates the characteristic \"ticking\" sound heard in operating mechanical clocks and watches. 3/4 Plate Layout The 3/4 plate and the balance cock are flush and about 1/4 of a full plate is cut out to allow for the balance, thus the 3/4 plate.
