PLEASE NOTE: We are Customer friendly and we don't attempt to make any money trying to sneak one by you and if something should get by us that results in an error in our listing that doesn't match the item description, you have three (3) days AFTER you receive it to notify us that you are sending it back, after which you have 14 days to get it back to us for a refund. Although we may like to think we are perfect because our parents told us we were, WE ARE NOT. We make mistakes like everyone else, however, we try our very best to workout any issues before they are problems, so don't forget to email us with any questions you may have and enjoy the experience. Good Luck Bidding!!! Payment & Shipping Details: Per eBay's policy, we only accept PayPal. First Class Mail Shipping in the USA is $3.95. Most First Class Mail International is $11.95. Shipping in the US includes Delivery Confirmation. For Domestic Sales, Insurance will automatically be included on items selling for over $50. International Sales must also go through Customs, so please know your Custom's Laws because if the item is held up in Customs, you will have to deal with it. Also, for International Buyers, please do not ask me to send the item as a gift or for less value than the sale price. First, you are asking me to break the customs laws in the U.S.A., as well as your country and second, I won't be able to add insurance to protect the item from loss or damage. Payment is expected within 5 days of Auction close, so please email with your intentions if it is going to be longer. This is especially true if you are sending payment by mail. I understand and will work with you, so please it only takes a minute to write an email. If you don't contact me, I will have to assume you are backing out of the contract. Communication is Important. Returns Policy: As we indicate below, this is our policy regarding returns. We sell antique and vintage items in an \"as is, as found\" condition for restoration or parts. These items have for the most part been in circulation for years, perhaps a hundred years or more, and we try our very best to note any problems or imperfections in our description. Also, because of their age, it is impossible for us to guarantee that items will work without some restoration. This is especially true with vintage watches. They are not performance guaranteed unless they are serviced by a professional and we leave the decision to service watches up to our customers. We only give refunds for things we fail to note in our description, so please email any questions or concerns you have about an item before you bid, especially if it is something that will make or break your buying decision. You might as well know all about it before you bid. To repeat: We are Customer friendly and we don't attempt to make any money trying to sneak one by you and if something should get by us resulting in an error in our description, you have three (3) days after you receive it to notify us that you are sending it back, after which you have 14 days to get it back to us for a refund. We make mistakes like everyone else and like most doing business on eBay, we try our very best to workout any issues before they are problems, so don't forget to email us.",
