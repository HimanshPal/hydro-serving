  "Description": "Hi, I'd like to offer You a beautiful vintage Russian hand-winding pocket watch MOLNIJA open-face with a relief ship on the back. The watch is tested running for 24 hours and is keeping excellent time for it's ages. But it's still a mechanical, and is not checked by a watchmaker, so please, don't expect a quartz accuracy. The look is excellent with some wear marks on the case and the glass - please, look at the pictures, as one picture says more than thousand words. The diameter is 50 mm. International buyers \u2013 Please note: Import duties, taxes, and charges are not included in the item price or shipping cost. These charges are the buyer's responsibility.

I will dispatch up to 1 business day after payment received, via BG POST INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED PRIORITY. Shipping time is out of my control, so please, be patient. I always keep a proof of postage. I have some more interesting watches, so please look at my other auctions. Payment - PayPal and Moneybookers.
