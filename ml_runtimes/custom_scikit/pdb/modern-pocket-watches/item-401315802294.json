Home & Garden Jewelry & Watches Sporting Goods Health & Beauty Clothing, Shoes & Accessories Crafts Selected Home & Garden Jewelry & Watches Sporting Goods Health & Beauty Clothing, Shoes & Accessories Crafts Smithsonian Institution JFK Half Dollar Pocket Watch Product Description: Inspired by the Smithsonians National Numismatic Collection, American coins honor the tradition and history of our country. A piece of history richly displayed in wearable form. The Silver Tone Half Dollar Coin Pocket Watch is the classic time piece. A simple but sleek silver tone case houses a genuine United States half dollar. The JFK Half Dollar first minted in 1964 was intended as a memorial to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

The pocket watch is 1 7/8 inches in diameter and hangs from a 14 inch steel fob open link chain.
