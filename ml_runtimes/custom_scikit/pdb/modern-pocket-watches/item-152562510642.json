  "Description": "A wonderful old pocket watch. It looks to be nearly new condition. It has a gorgeous gold tone metal case that features a raised design including a shield with a griffin inside in an antique gold metal. The face has a \"diamond\" in the center of the hands and the numbers are a bit modernist looking. The face is plastic and in very good condition. It measures about 2\" by 2\". The only flaw I could find was a bit of dust on the face...I tried to show it in photo. It winds and works great. It would make a great gift! SEE MY OTHER AUCTIONS FOR MORE GREAT ANTIQUES, COLLECTIBLES, AND ETC. **Please understand and agree to the following terms before bidding (ESPECIALLY SHIPPING INFORMATION): As I do with most of my auctions, I am offering this item AS-IS with no reserve. I sell a variety of items, mostly second hand...meaning used. I try to describe my items accurately and I allow the bidders to determine the value. Please email all questions prior to bidding. AS-IS is just a way of saying that all sales are final. (Unless of course the item description was grossly inaccurate.) It doesn't necessarily imply that there is something wrong with the item. I expect ALL questions to be asked prior to bidding. SHIPPING INFO: (Applies when not specified for pick-up ) Shipping is pre-calculated for this item. It is not negotiable. It covers all packaging, shipping and insurance costs. I can\u2019t possibly figure it accurately, as I have no idea where the package will be going or how much insurance it will need. It it makes the auctions go smoother if I give a shipping amount up front, so I try to estimate the cost. Once again\u2026It is not negotiable. I do not combine shipping costs - even if I combine packaging. I do not refund if I am over nor do I charge you if I have undercalculated (which is not uncommon). Please figure the shipping amount as part of your bidding amount...(Example...If shipping is $20 and you want to pay $80 for an item...then you should bid $60 for the item. This way it doesn't matter how much shipping is...you only pay what you are willing to pay for the item.) I don't try to make money on shipping...but I can't afford to lose money either. *** I usually ship within a day of receiving payment. I have indicated 3 days because stuff happens and a little breathing room is necessary. If you need an item quickly, please let me know and I will do my best to accomodate. PICK-UP: There is usually no charge for picking an item up personally, unless the item requires special packaging. Please contact me ASAP following the auciton to arrange for pick-up.
