  "Description": "Vtg La Marque Incabloc 17 Jewel 10 Microns Gold Ladies Pocket Watch & 12k Chain! DescriptionWelcome to my auction. Up for bids is this simply stunning vintage La Marque Incabloc 17 jewels ladies pocket watch! So delicate and ornate! In excellent working condition. I am no watch expert, so I could not remove the backing off of this watch without having to take the winder off and I was not about to attempt that. I believe based on the stamp on the edges that it is Swiss made. It is great condition cosmetically. Covered in 10 microns of yellow gold filled and no signs of wear. Crystal is clear and free of scratches. Nice Roman numerals face! Watch measures 1 7/8\" inches from top to bottom and 1 3/8\" from side to side. It comes with a 1/20 12k gold filled watch chain that measures 16.5\" inches long. Not sure of grams of gold. Watch chain needs loop for it to hook to the watch. Please ask any questions before bidding. Thanks for looking and God bless. : ) Payment We accept Paypal as method of payment.
