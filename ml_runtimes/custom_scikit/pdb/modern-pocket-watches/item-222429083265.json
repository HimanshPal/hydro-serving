  "Description": "Mathey Tissot is a high end watchmaker, though few in the USA know the name. It's second to none. Ladies necklace style watch, called Madison by Mathey Tissot. This is a wind up watch, not a battery operated quartz watch. 17 Jewel Movement. It even has an alarm with a separate winding mechanism. High class watch These sell for around 800 dollars or more new. Some models with extras like heavy gold and such sell for a LOT more. This watch is in pristine condition, but the box is not. It has some wear, mostly on the bottom as you would expect. I do not know the metal make up. It is gold tone, but I do not know if it's gold plate or what. Information on this model is very thin. I could find very little about it. Much about the company, all good things, like they're next to the ex-roller, a brand Ebay won't let me mention outright. However I found next to nothing on this watch specifically. Take a look around for yourself, and if you find out anything, let me know. Make offers, everyone watches but nobody offers. Any offer over 150 might get it. Be quick, first offer usually wins.",
