  "Description": "This item is in OK/Good condition. This is a nice vintage National Commemorative Archives Limited Edition JFK Pocket Watch. The seconds hand has come away from the timepiece, Pictured. I do not know how to get it open or test it to work. It does not seem too hard to open with the proper tools, but since I do not work on watches I leave that to new owner. Great project piece or left as is for display.
