  "Description": "Vintage Train Two Tone Silver Gold Tone Metal Embossed Pocket Watch Watch-It Japan Quartz With Chain This lovely vintage Watch-It pocket watch was found at an estate sale. It is silver and gold embossed and has a gold train on a railroad track with ornate silver flowers and leaves around the front and an ornate flower design on the back. The watch inside has a silver face with easy to read analog numbers. The pocket watch measures approximately 2.69\" long x 1.80\" in diameter x .58\" thick. The chain measures approximately 15 1/2\" long and clips on and is removable. It has Japan Quartz movement. It does have a new battery in it and is running. Please note that on the inside behind the top lid there is a little discoloration (please see last photo) but this may come off if you polish it. I have not cleaned this piece to preserve its vintage state. It is still in great vintage condition. It would make a great gift for someone special. Please note that most of my jewelry comes from estate sales and could need cleaning and since it is vintage some wear is normal. The condition of the item is my personal opinion and I try to give as accurate information as I can about the item to the best of my knowledge. Remember these are vintage items, that means someone at one point owned it and loved it...so when you get it please remember it is not new, it will have wear!
