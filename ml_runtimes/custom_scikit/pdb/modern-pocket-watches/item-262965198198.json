  "Description": "Metal: Sterling Silver Brand: Unknown. There is a marking on the toggle (see photos) it starts with an N. It looks like it might be Navarro? (Upon further research it matches other stamped pieces by David Navarro) It is stamped 925 on toggle and inside the ring with a Mexico stamp. Design: a belcher style silver chain (links 5mm across, 4mm wide). It is heavy (I don't have a scale currently so I can't speculate on weight, but it is very sturdy.) It has a toggle and a dangling detail that can be spun from a green side and a black side. Please see photos. Length: chain 18 inches (not including dangle, which is 1.5 inches) Width: dangle is 1 inch wide Condition: Great! There are two or three spots where it looks like they may have soldered it with a different metal and there is a darker spot that looks like tarnish. I tried to show them in the photos. May show slight signs of wear, but overall in great shape. Freshly cleaned! Like this item? Check out my other listings!
