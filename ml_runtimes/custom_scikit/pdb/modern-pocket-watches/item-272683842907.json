  "Description": "First of all, I apologize for not being a watch expert. This is a watch I inherited from my uncle that has been in a drawer since the mid 60's. I have wound it once a year or so and it always worked. I recently brought it to a Boston watch repair shop and talked to the AP store in NYC and the AP archivist in Switzerland where I got the following information: Audemars Piguet pocket watch sold by Gubelin, 18k yellow gold, champagne face, ultra-thin with a custom stand. Diameter 4 3/8 cm. Stands 6 cm. when on stand. Serial number 47580. Caliber SVF 5. 18 jewels. Case #505. Reference number 5606BA. Date of manufacture 1944. Sold to Gubelin, Switzerland in 1953. However, Selin Kaygun at the AP New York store gave me conflicting information saying it was from the mid to late 60s. The watch repair store in Boston inspected the watch and said it looks in surprisingly good shape, but will need a new stem soon. He wound it and asked me to check it the next day to see if it was keeping good time. It was, perhaps a minute slow. He also said it was very clean except for a little debris or mark at the 1:00 o'clock point. There are initials on the back. I do not know if the stand is gold or plated though I suspect the latter as it is quite strong. Anyway, happy to answer any questions, but remember, I am not an expert. No international shipping and only serious bidders please.On May-28-17 at 08:56:35 PDT, seller added the following information: Diameter of watch is 1.75\" and the thickness is 1/8\"",
