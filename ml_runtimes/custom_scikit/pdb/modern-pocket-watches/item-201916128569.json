Fob watches are cool!\" This functional prop replica watch can add an air of authenticity to a costume or add some Time Lord flare to your everyday life. This beautiful, fully working fob watch has detailed engraving on the case and features speech, light and sound effects, and watch chain. It's an excellent addition to your ensemble and a fun way to show your respect for the Doctor!
