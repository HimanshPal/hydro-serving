  "Description": "Not sure how old this watch is, but it's in good working order. I had put a new battery put in it last year, as it wasn't working at that time, but haven't had any problems with it working since I had replaced the battery. Now the battery is dead, so it needs a new one. Does not have a chain or band attached to it---just the watch alone. Will be shipped to the buyer with battery installed. The watch is approximately 1.5\" in diameter, and is 2\" with the chain attachment(where you set the watch). Check out my store, and check back frequently, as I'm adding items all the time.",
