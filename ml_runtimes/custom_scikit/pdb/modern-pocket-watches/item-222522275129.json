  "Description": "Date & Model: Antique (c.1920s): Up for your consideration is this \"As-Is\", but absolutely EXCEPTIONAL \"Estate\" and SCARCE, \"Higher-Grade\" SWISS 18s 17 Jewel Pocket Watch which is attributed to MOVADO (Ref. 999), and features THREE adjustments (Serial No. \"Unknown\", Regulator Model \"Unknown\", and coming to the High-Bidder COMPLETE in its original \"Unbranded\" and fitted Jeweler's Box, along with its original Chocolate Brown LEATHER fob). Yes, this particular pocket watch is steeped in British History and is BEST described as a 1926 General Strike \"Loyal Service Award\", with engraved interior plate reading as follows: Presented toHENRY FOWLESfor Loyal ServiceDuring the General StrikeMay, 2-12. 1926.---from---Angus Watson & Co. Ld. Newcastle-upon-Tyne Measurements: 2 & 13/16ths-of-an-Inch in total length (Base-to-Bale); 2&1/8ths-of-an-Inch at widest width/diameter; A Half-Inch deep --- Total Weight of 108.4 Grams. Runs: \"Does Run\" WITH 24hr Accuracy :-) And presents with a marvelously CLEAN Mechanism as Photographed Above; Yes, although appearing to remain in FULL WORKING order, a Professional Servicing/Cleaning is ALWAYS recommended on the fine and antique timepieces I auction, and with this \"Higher-Grade\" SWISS (Movado) Pocket Watch being sold \"As-Is\". Case: \"Very Good\" to \"Excellent\": With this \"Open-Face\" DENNISON \"Moon\" 10k Gold-Filled \"Open Face\" case appearing extremely TIGHT and streamlined, and displaying THREE \"dings\" or \"smallish dents\" at sides (As photographed, these \"dings\" are an EASY cosmetic repair and DO NOT affect display in the slightest); NO EXTERIOR \"Monograming\" or \"Engraving\". No further cosmetic issues noted, with this beauty requiring a professional polishing/steaming to make it \"Gleam Anew\". Crystal: \"Very Good\" to \"Excellent\": Remaining INTACT and tightly sealed with MINIMAL wear commensurate with LIGHT use. Dial: \"Excellent\": Truly EXCEPTIONAL, flawlessly CLEAN (Blemish-Free), with this enameled dial featuring the notably \"bolder\" MOVADO stylized Roman Numerals and maintaining ALL THREE hands (Minute, Second & Hour). ***** Spectacular Personal Indulgence or Memorable Gift ***** AJ",
