  "Description": "Vintage POCKET WATCH Brand: La Salle Express. Made in Switzerland. Circa 1930s. MOVEMENT: Swiss made, 16 size, open face, twenty-one (21) jewels. Stem wind, stem set. No visible serial number on movement. Nice damaskeened nickel plates. Runs very good at time of listing, on various positions. Keeps very good time after several hours. Completely serviced-oiled-timed last year by an expert watchmaker. CASE: \"Empress\" gold filled case, serial #3417585, made in Canada. Pretty nice, not much visible brassing or wear. Nicely decorated on back. The bezel and back cover screw down correctly. Measures about 51.4 mm wide, by 67.9 mm tall to top of crown (without swing ring); 19.7 mm thick. (That's roughly 2\" wide; 2 5/8\" tall; 0.77\" thick). CRYSTAL: Antique one. Pretty nice and clear. There are a couple very minor edge chips only visible with a loupe (around 6 o'clock, located underneath glass, between crystal & bezel. Top edges are nice & sharp though). Still displays very well. DIAL: Good condition, displays very nice! Arabic 12 hours & small Arabic seconds in red, from 1 to 60. Measures 42.7 mm diameter. Marked \"LA SALLE Express, 21 Jewels, Swiss Made\". Dial has been ultrasonically deep-cleaned. There are a couple minor \"clean\" hairlines only visible with a loupe or microscope. No chips anywhere. All three blue steel hands are correct, and in very good condition. TOTAL WEIGHT OF WATCH: 92 grams. Please scroll down for more details, and check out my pictures below. NOTE: I will list a few pocket watches on Ebay in the coming weeks, coming from a collector. All restorations are top-notch, made by a leading expert in that field. And all those watches are keeping good time. More watches listed in my store.
