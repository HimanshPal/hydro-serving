  "Description": "Hi, I'd like to offer You a vintage Russian pocket watch RAKETA (\u0420\u0410\u041a\u0415\u0422\u0410, means ROCKET) with a gold-plated case. The watch is tested running for 24 hours and is keeping excellent time for it's ages. The date doesn't fit proper in the windows. But it's still a mechanical, and is not checked by a watchmaker, so please, don't expect a quartz accuracy. Dimensions are: diameter 40 mm, thickness 10 mm. The look is excellent, with some wear marks on the case and the glass - please, look at the pictures, as one picture says more than thousand words. International buyers \u2013 Please note: Import duties, taxes, and charges are not included in the item price or shipping cost. These charges are the buyer's responsibility. Please check with your country's customs office to determine what these additional costs will be prior to bidding or buying. I will dispatch up to 1 business day after payment received, via BG POST INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED PRIORITY. Delivery time is out of my control, so please, be patient. I always keep a proof of postage. I have some more interesting watches (mainly Russian - Poljot, Raketa, Slava, Pobeda, Molnija), so please look at my shop. Payment - PayPal. If You intend to pay after 3 or more days, please let me know. Any questions - please don't hesitate to ask. Good luck with bidding.",
