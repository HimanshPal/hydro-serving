  "Description": "Hi, I'd like to offer You a beautiful vintage Russian hand-winding pocket watch MOLNIJA open-face with a relief scene with wolves on the back. The watch is tested running for 24 hours and is keeping excellent time for it's ages. But it's still a mechanical, and is not checked by a watchmaker, so please, don't expect a quartz accuracy. The look is excellent with some wear marks on the case and the glass. The dial has two small holes at 4:30 and 10:30, maybe pins of the dial are broken - please, look at the pictures, as one picture says more than thousand words. The diameter is 50 mm. International buyers \u2013 Please note: Import duties, taxes, and charges are not included in the item price or shipping cost. These charges are the buyer's responsibility. Please check with your country's customs office to determine what these additional costs will be prior to bidding or buying. I will dispatch up to 1 business day after payment received, via BG POST INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED PRIORITY. Shipping time is out of my control, so please, be patient. I always keep a proof of postage. I have some more interesting watches, so please look at my other auctions. Payment - PayPal and Moneybookers. If You intend to pay after 3 or more days, please let me know. Any questions - please don't hesitate to ask. Good luck with bidding.",
