  "Description": "This vintage watch needs a new battery, outer case is good vintage condition. Watch chain included. Door opens and closes good. SR762 My Jewerly and collectibles come from estate sales. They are all pre owed unless other wise stated. Pictures are a MAJOR part of the description. Please review all pictures. I do NOT clean any of it as I do not want to damage the pieces. Any white, yellow or orange spots in the photos are flash glare from my camera, or reflection off my walls, unless specifically mentioned as otherwise - i'll always do my best to mention any damage or excessive blemishes in the auction description. If you do not agree with all our terms and conditions listed below please do not complete your purchase. We ship products Monday - Friday, and do not ship on Federal Holidays as the Post office is closed on those days. I welcome all questions. Customer service is very important to me please contact me and I will do my best to meet your needs. I do combine shipping and will work it to give you the best price I can give. Please email me if you are bidding on more then one item. Wait until I send you a revised invoice before paying if buying more then one item. I will NOT refund shipping if you do not wait for the new invoice. I Only use Paypal for payment. Payment is expected within 3 business days of listings end unless prior arrangements have been made. If payment isn't made within 3 days I will open an unpaid case. Thank you for considering!",
