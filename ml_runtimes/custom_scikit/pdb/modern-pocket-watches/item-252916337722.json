  "Description": "One of the most fascinating and unique timepieces made by Audemars Piguet. We are talking about the ultra rare Audemars Piguet Coin Watch in 18K yellow gold. As far as we know, these rare coin watches were created by Audemars Piguet between 1915 and the late 1980s. The coin watches were produced in very limited quantities and in different currencies including U.S. dollars, Swiss Francs, French Francs and Mexican Pesos. This particular twenty dollar coin watch, features a bas-relief portrait of the Lady of Liberty with the year 1897 on the obverse and the legend 'United States of America Twenty Dollars' along with the Great Seal of the United States of America on the reverse. The coin is 22k gold, the Watch case is 18k. \u2028 Concealed inside the 18K yellow gold coin \u2014measuring 34 mm in diameter\u2014, there is a special surprise: a small manual wound watch that is only accessible by pressing a hidden recessed push button that is almost invisible to the naked eye as it is milled as part of the reeds and only visible upon very close inspection. \u2028 After carefully pressing the hidden button with your nail, the hinged top \u2014obverse side\u2014 will then reveal a beautifully finished swing-out watch with winding crown at 1 o'clock. The small watch with an 18K yellow gold case measuring close to 24 mm in diameter, features a gorgeous matte off-white dial with gilded batons and needle-shaped hands. To ease the process of setting and telling time, the watch can be tilted upwards all the way up to an angle of 115 degrees. The hinged lid only goes up to a 90 degree angle. \u2028 The winding crown located at the 1 o'clock position around the fluted case band is really minuscule but very easy to operate even for those with large fingertips. The beating heart inside this exceptional piece of 'haute horlogerie', is the Audemars Piguet manual wound calibre 2005/1 with 17 jewels and which provides a power reserve of 32 hours when fully wound. The movement is protected by a solid snap-on case back that is highly polished and properly minted with the respective gold engravings. To round up the elegant design of this timepiece, both the hinged cover and the area where the watch is set to rest when closing the lid are delicately finished with 'perlage\u2019. \u2028 \u2028 If you like pocket watches and you are ready to have a true conversation piece that will wow everyone around you, this Audemars Piguet Coin Watch is as good as it gets.",
