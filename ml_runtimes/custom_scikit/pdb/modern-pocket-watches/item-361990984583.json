  "Description": "Most items were purchased at estate auctions and are being sold in an \"as found\" condition. I do no repairs, alterations and very little cleaning. SIZE DESCRIPTION: The case is about 1 1/2\" in diameter. There is a $1.50 handling fee included in domestic shipping charges and a $2.50 handling fee for international shipping. The handling charge is only applied once per package. SEVERAL SMALL ITEMS CAN OFTEN BE SHIPPED FOR THE SHIPPING COST OF ONE. This does not apply to very heavy or large items because they will need to be shipped separately. In the event you win more than one item you may have to contact me so that I can adjust the invoice. Thanks for looking!! Wayne (280)-S",

If the watch does not work after getting a new battery it may be shipped back for a full refund including return shipping charges. There are no markings that include \"Quartz\" but I assume that it is. It also does not have markings indicating it's brand.",
