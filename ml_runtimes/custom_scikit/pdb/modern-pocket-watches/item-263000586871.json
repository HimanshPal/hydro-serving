  "Description": "Home Shop About Us Policies Contact Us Mudder Golden Skeleton Mens Hand Winding Mechanical Pocket Watch Mudder golden skeleton mens hand winding mechanical pocket watch Golden pocket watch: This classic plated flip-case pocket watch combines vintage tastes with the modern, durable practicality of a quartz movement pocket watch. This watch opens at the push of a button and closes tight. Delicate and unique design: The vintage pocket watch has pretty floral carvings on it and a large window you can see the gears through; This watch comes with the good length of matching chain with clip allowing secure attachment to jeans or pants. Easy to adjust time: Press the button to open the cover, pull the crown away from base of the watch and turn the crown clockwise until reaching the exact time. Winding the watch: Push the crown back into place along the base of the watch and wind up the watch clockwise rotation with 20 times. The power will be full (Over winding will ultimately break the spring). Do this one time each day (before sleeping). Otherwise, it will stop working. Please do not over winding up the watch if you feel the crown is tight. Good gift: The pocket watch has a very attractive face, with clear numbers and pretty chain.
