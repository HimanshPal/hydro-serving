We started out many years ago specializing in Sci-fi toys and action figures, and have since expanded our line to most any and everything that can be bought and sold. Most of our items come from purchasing wholesale lots and/or estates. We often try to find the best deals on what we believe the consumer will want. No items are too small and no price is too large. We handle everything from your grandmother's antique thimble collection to your unwanted motorhome. We are always interested in purchasing your unwanted collectibles and antiques. If we cannot come to an agreement, we will still be interested in selling the item(s) for you. Our consignment fees are extremely fair, and we work hard to get you the best price possible. RogueTraderAZ will handle all of the details regarding advertising, sales transaction, and collection of the money. Shipping All orders to be processed within 24-48 hours after purchase has been completed. **PLEASE NOTE** The shipping estimate provided by eBay is ONLY an estimate, and it is NOT provided by us. Shipping times can be varied due to location, service used, weather conditions, a flat tire, a postal worker's error, your carrier could be bitten by a dog, the post office may ship it to another planet first!! ANY number of reasons except one - fault on our part. Please understand that we are NOT in control of the post office, and if any information regarding tracking your package is needed all we can see is the same information as you, the buyer can see when reviewing your tracking number. **All packages will be secure and protected, but this does not always prevent damage sustained during shipping. Please consider this before purchasing and contact us if you would like to make other arrangements for your purchase. Thank You for your understanding :) Returns/Refunds Please check the returns option of this listing. Most items are NOT returnable. Returns MUST be authorized before sending any product back.

Please consider this before purchasing and contact us if you would like to make other arrangements for your purchase. Thank You for your understanding :) ******************* PLEASE READ Due to the unwavering policies that are forced upon sellers, shipping used to almost always be free for RogueTraderAZ's listings. We will now be implementing shipping fees and doing our best to keep them realistic. Also due to the unwavering policies forced upon sellers, RogueTraderAZ will no longer be offering returns as the default option on their listings. Each return request will be dealt with on an individual basis. Return requests through eBay\u2019s resolution center will be automatically declined. When returning an item for refund, RogueTraderAZ reserves the right to retain compensation of actual expenses incurred from the original delivery of the product and will therefore lead to only a partial refund of the total sale. Each amount in this case varies based on shipping fees, and will be determined as needed.** **The key here is to want what you've ordered, and if there are any complications at all, PLEASE CONTACT US!! ******************* Feedback Policy It is RogueTraderAZ's goal is to make sure that you are completely satisfied with your transaction, so much so that you will be leaving us positive feedback.
