  "Description": "VINTAGE UNIQUE St. BLAISE \"KEY-WATCH\" POCKET WATCH with GREY LEATHER CASE...2 Pockets (one on each side of case to fit key into), ALUMINUM KEY BLANK and Small Ring. TAKE A LOOK AT THE PICTURES...they are part of our description. Circa 1950's-1960's...give or take a few years. Condition is VERY GOOD, some wear to be expected...it WORKS when I wound it up, the Second Hand moves, but then it stops, if I shake it moves again...has not been used in years, how well it works, I don't really know?? Probably needs to be cleaned. Case looks like it's Stainless Steel, but it could be Chrome-Plated?? Does not attract to a Magnet. Crystal is scratched. Looks like the Hands ILLUMINATED in the dark (may have faded some?), as well as Little Squares on inside of the Deep Sage Green/Blue Ring (matches lighter color in the Hands) on the Face. Signed on the Face: KEY-WATCH, St. BLAISE, 7 JEWELS, SWISS MADE; on the Back: U.S. PAT. PEND., BREV. DEP., in the center of the Back: ANTIMAGNETIC, INCABLOG, SWISS, 1200. The WATCH is on a SWIVEL BALL that allows the KEY to MOVE AWAY from the WATCH, and be Used. Aluminum BLANK KEY has not been used, and can be made to fit your CAR or HOUSE...it fits into one of the pockets that is on either side of the Grey Leather Case, that it's attached to...Matching Leather String Attached with a Little Metal Loop, so other keys can be added if you want, or attach it to something else. Overall size is about 1-3/8\" Wide in Diameter (1-1/2\" Wide with Stem) x 3\" Long (when in case); Crystal is about 1-1/8\" Wide in Diameter, I'm not sure if it's glass or plastic, (I think it's plastic), but it has a few scratches. I'm not too familiar with watches, only what I've been able to find out on the internet. BUY IT AS IS. WONDERFUL VINTAGE UNIQUE POCKET WATCH ADDITION TO ANY COLLECTION...GREAT GIFT TOO!
