  "Description": "About usI now accept consignments. I started selling on eBay to share with others some of the many stamps that I had accumulated over the past 40 years and had the pleasure of selling to some really terrific customers that returned to see what I would list next. Now I have turned this into a hobby and I want to offer to you who may be viewing this a great experience in buying on eBay. I try to offer the buyer a lower price than most others on eBay.Refund or Replacement Policy:100% Customer satisfaction is guaranteed. Any defective products will be refunded or replaced for free within 7 days after arrival. Please contact me for further instructions so that I can make things right.Feedback:I appreciate your Positive Feedback and will do the same in return.If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me with eBay messaging before you leave any neutral/negative feedback or open case. I will resolve the problem to your satisfaction.I can't stress this point enough if you choose to file an open case I will have a hard time finding out who you are and your order. Therefore, wasting my time and yours. So, please message me first.Receipts are now given upon request only.There are quite a few that are paying for individual orders, if you could wait until the end of the day so that I can send you an updated invoice with all combined orders, it would be much appreciated.Thank you for bidding and have a very good day!
