  "Description": "Description:1.A pocket watch (or pocketwatch) is a watch that is made to be carried in a pocket, as opposed to a wristwatch, which is strapped to the wrist. They were the most common type of watch from their development in the 16th century until wristwatches became popular after World War I during which a transitional design, trench watches were used by the military.2.Pocket watches generally have an attached chain to allow them to be secured to a waistcoat, lapel, or belt loop, and to prevent them from being dropped. Watches were also mounted on a short leather strap or fob, when a long chain would have been cumbersome or likely to catch on things. This fob could also provide a protective flap over their face and crystal. Women's watches were normally of this form, with a fob that was more decorative than protective. Chains were frequently decorated with a silver or enamel pendant, often carrying the arms of some club or society, which by association also became known as a fob.3.Ostensibly \"practical\" gadgets such as a watch winding key, vesta case or a cigar cutter also appeared on watch chains, although usually in an overly decorated style. Also common are fasteners designed to be put through a buttonhole and worn in a jacket or waistcoat, this sort being frequently associated with and named after train conductors.Main Feature:Three hands and black markers for easy readingLooks simple with 12 Arabic numerals on the dialThis exquisite pocket watch is in great condition and running perfectlyThe chain antique pocket watch is high crafted finishing and polished for comfortable fitChain antique pocket watch adds a classic touch to every outfit with this simple pocket watchBattery included in the watchWater resistant (not for diving/swimming)It's worth to buy for cheap and having a good quality Specifications:The chain is about 78 cm longProduct weight: 50 gProduct size (L x W x H): 5.5 x 4.3 x 1.3 cm Package Contents:1 x Pocket Watch",
