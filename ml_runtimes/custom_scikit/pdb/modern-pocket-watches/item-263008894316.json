  "Description": "Basis (Swiss) 53mm Demi-Hunter Pocket Watch Swiss; Basis; Man\u2019s; C. 1920\u2019s CASE: The yellow base metal 53mm demi-hunter case displays machined decorations. DIAL: This silver metal dial features Arabic numerals and spade hands. MOVT: The pin-set no jewels gilt movement has a lever escapement and \u00be-plate layout. CONDITIONS: C 3 (The case is in very good condition) D 3-9 (The dial is in very good condition, slightly scratched) M 3 (The movement is in very good condition) AI-UN42016-25 Demi-Hunter A hunter case with the center designed to allow the position of the hands to be seen without opening the case. Stem-wind, Pin-Set Movements Much like the lever-set movements, these pocket watches had a small pin or knob next to the watch-stem that had to be depressed before turning the crown to set the time and releasing the pin when the correct time had been set. This style of watch is occasionally referred to as \"nail set\", as the set button must be pressed using a finger. Lever Escapement An escapement is a device in mechanical watches and clocks that transfers energy to the timekeeping element (the \"impulse action\") and allows the number of its oscillations to be counted (the \"locking action\"). The impulse action transfers energy to the clock's timekeeping element (usually a pendulum or balance wheel) to replace the energy lost to friction during its cycle and keep the timekeeper oscillating. The escapement is driven by force from a coiled spring or a suspended weight, transmitted through the timepiece's gear train. Each swing of the pendulum or balance wheel releases a tooth of the escapement's escape wheel gear, allowing the clock's gear train to advance or \"escape\" by a fixed amount. This regular periodic advancement moves the clock's hands forward at a steady rate. At the same time the tooth gives the timekeeping element a push, before another tooth catches on the escapement's pallet, returning the escapement to its \"locked\" state. The sudden stopping of the escapement's tooth is what generates the characteristic \"ticking\" sound heard in operating mechanical clocks and watches. 3/4 Plate Layout The 3/4 plate and the balance cock are flush and about 1/4 of a full plate is cut out to allow for the balance, thus the 3/4 plate.
