It's just the right size. My husband is very proud of his watch. 5.0 out of 5 stars Nice pocket watch - excellent gift!Verified PurchaseThe pictures make this look a little too \"shinny\" and almost \"fake\" in real life the gold tone and design is much more handsome for sure. I purchased this for my 7 year old son to teach him about timepieces and how to tell the time on an analog watch (and a little about how to respect and care for things). I wasn't expecting to find such a nice timepiece but have been really impressed I think I'll buy once (perhaps one in silver and gold). I'm not too sure what the reserve time is but would expect it to be less than a day but who knows perhaps one could go longer without winding it. The plating seems to be of nice quality and is polished to a nice sheen. The double \"hunter\" covers are what he wanted and both open with a consecutive push of the crown. For less than half this watch's cost I'd imagine you could get a real basic manual watch but would also end up with a gaudy/ugly watch - this one is very nice looking and tasteful. I doubt that this will ever become an heirloom but would make a nice statement compared to a $20 timex wristwatch or no watch at all - which seems to be the trend with cell phones receiving time off network. At the price I'd say this is a \"buy\" for sure. You may be able to find a 100 year old watch for about double this one's cost but it would probably require work to get it or keep it going - this piece may lack a bit of the antique's \"charm\" or \"history\" but you'll actually get to use this one (not continually be back at the watch shop) and also not feel guilty about putting it in your pocket day after day. ========== TOTALLY FREE SHIPPING =========== We are striving to be a 100% positive eBay seller.
