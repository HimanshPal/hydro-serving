  "Description": "Thank you for visiting our ebay store! How to open a pocket watch? On the top of the crown (most common) or on the side of the watch case (uncommon) there is a small spring loaded latch button. Simply pressing downward on the button will release the latch that holds the cover closed. The watch cover will then spring open. How to wind a pocket watch? If you have a mechanical pocket watch it will need to be wound daily.The watch is wound by turning the watch crown in a clockwise direction.Most watches take around 30-40 half turns to be fully wound.Stop winding when the crown no longer easily turns, you should feel a sudden stop.Be careful not to force the watch by over winding.You will over time get used to the feel of your watch,and winding will become second nature.During your daily winding is also a good time to double check and set the time. Setting time: First find the watch crown or stem.The crown is the small knob that is attached to the stem; it is located between the watch bow and case.Next you pull lightly outward on the crown.You will usually feel a click when you pull out the stem.Once the stem is in the fully extended position you then turn or twist the crown to adjust the hands of the watch.Once you have set the watch to the correct time you simply push the stem back in to the original position.
