  "Description": "ALPS Pocket Watch Mens Steampunk Bronze Skeleton Automatic Mechanical Pocket Watchs Hand Wind (Rose Gold) Description Features: Stainless steel case with alloy chain Classic skeleton design with precise mechanical-hand-wind Removable chain with hook Specification(approximate): Case diameter: approx 4.6 cm (1.8 inch) Case thickness: approx 1.5 cm (cover included) (0.6 inch) Chain length: approx 37.5 cm (hook included) (14.8 inch) Watch weight: approx. 71 g Package includes: 1 Pocket watch 1 Chain 1 Watch box 1 Small gift How to Wind a hand wind mechanical watch ? 1.Remove the wrist watch from your arm or storage. It is not advisable to wind a watch while it is on the arm because, with the watch tight against the skin, the winding motion may not be effective. 2. Hold the watch face up in your left hand. Reverse the position, of course, if left- handed. The stem may have several settings, including settings for time, calendar, alarm, or time zone. The settings are located at little \"clicks\" as you pull the stem out or push it in. Use trial and error to feel the clicks and identify the winding position. 3. Use the thumb and index finger to carefully pull out the watch stem by the stem's top or \"crown.\" This can be difficult because you do not want to over-wind the mechanism. Be conservative; stop when you feel resistance, but if the watch runs down sooner than you like, you know you did not quite hit the maximum tension. In time, you will develop a feel for the resistance. 4 Turn the stem forward repeatedly until some resistance is felt. Depending on the size of the watch, 20 to 40 forward turns should lead to resistance; over-winding will strain or break the mechanism. 5 Press the crown to return stem to its place. Features: CLASSIC SKELETON DESIGN: Stainless case and exquisite engraving on the case removable stainless brass tone chain with a clip at the endHAND WIND MECHANICAL MOVEMENT:Functions without a battery; powers with mechanical movementHOW TO WIND THE WATCH:Please wind the mechanical watch by turning the crown clockwise for 15 to 20 complete revolutions every day. Over 20 times may do harm to the watch mechanism.WATERPROOF FOR DAILY USE: Daily use waterproof, not suitable for underwater activities - such as shower, swimming, ect.HIGH COST-EFFECTIVE:Good quality with low price, great gift for your friends Product Details: Product Dimensions: 3.4 x 2.7 x 1.1 inchesShipping Weight: 4 ounces",
