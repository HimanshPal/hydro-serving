Shipping cost are stated here for USA buyers in all my auctions and I know that I ship quickly (international buyers please email me for s&h cost). Each package I ship there is handling cost added to the cost of actual shipping. I have a varied inventory and this makes handling fees vary. For example: The handling fee for a pin would be different then sending for a collectible, art work etc. Some packages require more supplies which have become very costly we try and cut corners as best we can but every day we are faced with more expenses. Some of my packages are packed and shipped by a privately owned packing house. These packages take longer to prepare for shipment I have no control when they will ship I will email you as soon as they ship. These are Large pieces. Shipping time will take longer than normal on large pieces. 3. Shipping Time If a package is delayed you will know why if the problem is on my end. This way you are never disappointed in my shipping time. I really try hard to do my best. 4. Shipping notices I send out I send out direct emails to you when I have either processed or shipped your package and give you the shipping date in this email for all post office shipments along with delivery conformation numbers USA buyers, for international buyers you will have the CJ, LC or LN numbers come in this email. Some emails have not been accepted by some email spam filters. I also try to send you an email though my ebay that notice not will not show the actual date of the shipment and will just say that your package has been shipped. For the expensive or bulky item such as some toys, collectibles, art work etc I use DHL, FedEx or UPS. Some emails from my ebay may not come with tracking numbers when I use these services. If you want them email me for them and I will be happy to email them to you. I do not ship over the weekends. 5. Shipping Time Remember I have no control over shipping delays once I have shipped out your package. I try to please everyone but sometimes this is an impossible task I hope that I meet your full expectations and you are happy with my service. If I do not please tell me where I can improve.
