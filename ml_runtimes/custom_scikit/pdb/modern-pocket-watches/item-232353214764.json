UPS shipping includes full insurance for ALL items and Signature Confirmation for higher value items (this is a big part of our shipping cost and is there for your protection \u2013 on a $500 item over $7 of the shipping cost is due to the insurance and confirmation). In-transit delivery times can be up to 10 days for USPS First Class and Priority \u2013 the time is NOT guaranteed and we cannot control that.
