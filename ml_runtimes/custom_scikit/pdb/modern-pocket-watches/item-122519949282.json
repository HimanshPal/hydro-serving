I am an honest seller with 19+ years on Ebay, please check my FB for review. Due to all the changes in Ebay policies, many items will not be relisted. Changes are constantly coming our way as sellers, so please bid while auctions are active. Please look carefully at the pictures and ask questions before bidding. All items are previously owned and used unless otherwise specified. They may need cleaning.\u3000 Pet free, smoke-free environment! Thanks for looking! Shipping is usually the next business day following purchase, but always within 4 days. If shipping is more than the estimate, the buyer must pay the difference. If shipping is less than specified, please remember to allow for insurance, then the balance will be refunded to you. I don't get the shipping money, and I don't overcharge you. It will only cost you what I pay to ship your item. There is a 20% re-stocking fee on all returns and buyer pays return shipping. I only ship to USA! COMBINED SHIPPING We do offer combined and sometimes free shipping on multiple items. It is always nice to hear from a buyer within a few hours after the auction has ended. Payment is expected within 4 days. If there is a problem, please let me know immediately so that we may work it out. Please note that we use Ebay's Unpaid Assistant, and Unpaid Item Cases are automatically opened by Ebay on the 4th day of non-payment. Once opened, the case will not close until payment is received. As a buyer as well as a seller, I realize the importance of letting my seller know when to expect payment. DO NOT DUPLICATE OR COPY!
