  "Description": "Going through the many, many boxes that I inherited, that were stored in an air conditioned storage down here in Florida, I found a box of vintage, rare and unique watches including this very rare find: a Lubriderm pocket watch that looks to be made of solid chrome with a blue accent. When I found this pocket watch I installed a brand new battery (which I am including) and so far it has kept great time. This pocket watch measures 1-3/4\" around, up to 3/8\" thick, and has an outside ring with minutes in increments of five. This pocket watch is digital and on the back there is engraved the word \"Lubriderm\". This pocket watch has me stumped on what \"Lubriderm\" means, it may be a promotion watch for the lotion Lubriderm. I dare you to find another because I couldn't. Attached to this pocket watch there is a 16\" 100% chrome chain fob with a large quick-release chrome belt-loop clip. I love these pocket watches with the long fobs because it doesn't matter what year it is, wearing one is always in style. WOW~BUY A TREASURE BUT SAVE A FORTUNE!!!

My Policies:I return feedback-so please leave me one and I will do the same.Review my feedbacks and you will be delighted to bid with confidence.Sorry, but \"SOMETIMES\" shipping to Alaska and Hawaii is an extra charge.Even if listed \"No Returns\" or \"As Is\" I will only refund if items are \"MISREPRESENTED\".All items come from a non-smoking, air conditioned household.Normally I ship out the same day you buy, that way you receive your item PRONTO, but items will be shipped with-in 3 business days! Hey, so spoil yourself or make a loved one very happy!!! THANK YOU FOR LOOKING AND GOOD LUCK!!! (:{]COMBINED SHIPPING SPECIAL: I am running a special on combined shipping. After you purchase your first item from me, take a look at my over 200 listings and from then on any shipping cost of $14.99 or less on all the items that you would purchase, the cost on the shipping would only be 99 cents per item. And any item that has a $15.99 shipping charge I will discount $10.00. This is a huuuge savings on your purchases (I totally hate the shipping part of the sale, and I know the buyers hate it more, plus the shipping prices are getting higher and higher). Also, if you purchase an item and plan to shop around and buy other items, don't pay for the items until you are done shopping and just send me a note that you are done and I will send you a corrected invoice with all the shipping deductions so you will have the lower adjusted total. I will charge the largest shipping cost of all items to be shipped in one box and the rest of the items will be charged the reduced combined shipping special rate.",
