  "Description": "WATCH DESCRIPTION WATCH Brand: Iskra Series: 116154 Gender: Mens CASE Material: Chrome SIZE: 50mm Thickness: 11mm FEATURES Bezel: - Water Resistance no Dial: White MOVEMENT Type: Mechanical: Hand-winding Caliber: YK 30 BAND Type: ADDITIONAL INFO Warranty: No Tech Info: Hours, Minutes, Sub Seconds. THE WATCH IS IN GOOD CONDITION AND TIME KEEPING ORDER! Russian movements were often introduced with a pretty name, like Molnia (=lightning).Later the movements got number codes which are often misinterpreted as calibre designation. Actually the first pair of digits indicate the diameter im millimeters (36mm here), the second the main features, e.g. 02 for manual wind with sub second and without shock devices, or 03 for the same with shock devices.While other movements got suffixes like 1, 2 or H, 2H (for new and even newer), the designation for this long line of movements remained 3602, although many modifications were applied. Even the older 3.5mm high variants and the newer with 4.65mm got no different designations, although they have almost no common parts.Also the character of the designation Molnia changed with time. First it was a calibre name, which is also written on the older variants made by the 2nd Watch Factory (brand Slava); accordingly these variants are occasionally called Slava 3602. When production was tranfered to the Chelyabinsk Watch Factory the designation remained, but extended with 3602. Molnia alone became a model name for watches with this movement. Later Molnia was registered as trademark of the Chelyabinsk Watch Factory, and the movements got the Molnia logo, a dial with hands. Unfortunately different sources give scarcely consistent informations about the evolution of these movements. This archive therefore restricts to existing samples, their features, and production periodes, as far as can be taken from signatures and informations from first owners. The respective signatures are translated. This should do for a first estimation and for successful sourcing of spare parts.
