  "Description": "This is a very Nice NASCAR Number 3 Pocket Watch with Chain. It has a black face with a gold number 3 in the dial, gold hands, Pre-owned in good overall condition. Tested running with new battery installed. Mild tarnish on chain from age. Watch case in very good condition, gold tone with stainless back. Measures approx. 1 3/4\" diameter overall, +13\" chain. Please look at the pictures as they are part of the description. All watches are sold AS-IS and there are no guarantees or warranties since they are all USED. They have been tested, but only for a short period of time. There could be issues that went unnoticed during the time of the testing. If unable to test the item there is a possibility of the item having an unknown defect. The functions (digital watches) work but I cannot guarantee the accuracy. Some scratches may not show up on camera. May not be waterproof. Please take a good look at the pics to see what you are getting! Watches that use batteries only (please disregard if you are purchasing a mechanical watch): Some of the batteries have been replaced, some have not if the watches were running when they were purchased. The watches are all running when shipped, but there is a possibility that the battery could even go out on it's way to you. It depends on how old the battery in any particular watch is. You can buy replacement batteries right here on eBay for a very cheap cost!!If there is ever any issues with a purchased item, PLEASE contact me before opening a case or return, I try very hard to make sure customers are happy with purchases and would greatly appreciate your communication first. Feedback is extremely important and will take great efforts in solving any problems. Thank you!",
