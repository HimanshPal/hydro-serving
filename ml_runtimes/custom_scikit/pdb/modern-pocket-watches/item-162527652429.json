For an estimate regarding my combined shipping policy, please message me about the items you are interested in, along with your zip code, and I will reply as soon as possible. Please plan on paying for your purchase within three days. This allows me to ship quickly, and makes for a better eBay experience for all of us. Returns Generally, I do not accept returns. I endeavor to describe my items accurately AND answer questions promptly. If, in the event that I have made a mistake in the item description, you are covered under eBay\u2019s return policy. Additional Information Regarding Glassware and Breakables All of my breakable and glassware items are shipped via Priority Mail, which includes insurance on the package. In the rare event that your item has been damaged as a result of rough handling through the post office, you will need to take the sales record of your purchase and the item to your nearest post office to file an insurance claim form. The post office will then reimburse your purchase and shipping costs. I WILL NOT ISSUE REFUNDS BASED ON DAMAGES DURING SHIPPING!! I pride myself on packing and shipping very well, and damages are rare, but it does, at times happen. Feedback Feedback is an important resource for sellers as well as buyers. Please leave feedback at your earliest convenience, and I will do the same for you.
