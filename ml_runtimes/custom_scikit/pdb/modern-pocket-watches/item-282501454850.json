  "Description": "U.S. Buyers only. I do not accept international buyers. No exceptions. Thanks.(1445)Vintage Majestime 17 Jewels Ladies Pocket Watch w. 1928 Cameo Chain Necklace:This is a lovely pocket watch pendant with a signed 1928 plastic cameo station chain necklace. The watch works and keeps good time. Weighs 28grams. Please see pictures for size and measurements in inches (each big square represents 1 inch). Overall condition is excellent. Feel free to e-mail me for any questions. Please view my other listings as I am listing lots of unique items this week. Have fun bidding. TERMS OF SALE: Due to the recent changes in U.S. International Postal Regulations, I can no longer accept international buyers on jewelry items. I am very sorry about that. I will only ship within the U.S.. U.S. buyers pay $5.50 shipping cost (first class mail in jewelry box with padded envelope and delivery confirmation). Will combine shipping for $1.00 extra each additional item which ended the same week. Payment is expected in 7 working days at end of auction. We accept PayPal and other payment methods (Please contact me for details). I ship on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Antique, vintage and estate pieces are all pre-owned and will have usual wear. All measurements are approximate. All sales final. No buyers remorse is accepted. If you are the winning bidder, you will enter into a legally binding contract to purchase the item from the seller.",
