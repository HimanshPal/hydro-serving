  "Description": "Phillip Crowe Signature Series Pocketwatch; Buck/Deer Print~Requires Battery~Condition: Pre-owned(Good used condition. Normal wear.)~Thanks so much for looking and happy bidding!~ALL ITEMS COME FROM A SMOKE-FREE HOME!Please be sure to check other listings in my Store! **A FEW THINGS TO NOTE:-I guarantee 100% authenticity on ALL of my items sold here. If you have any questions please don\u2019t hesitate to ask.-I do NOT accept returns. Why? Because I have no idea what you do with the item once you\u2019ve received it. Please, if you have ANY questions, ask. I try to accurately describe my items as closely as possible, but I can\u2019t account for \u201cthere was glitter on the sweatshirt but I didn\u2019t zoom in on the picture and don\u2019t like it now that I\u2019ve received it\u201d or \u201cthese shoes are too tight although we wear the same size (yet for myself, they were extremely comfortable)\u201d. AKA, I\u2019ve dealt with some annoying buyers\u2026 please don\u2019t be one of those. J -Need specific seam measurements on clothing items or accessories? No problem. Just send me a message on what you need and I can get the measurement for you.-Need more pictures of a certain angle, tag, etc? Again \u2013 no problem. Send a message and I\u2019ll do my best to get that for you.-Please allow up to 3 business days for processing. I know this may be an inconvenience, but I work a full-time healthcare job that unfortunately sometimes requires me to be gone up to 15 hours at a time and eBay shipping gets delayed. Please don't hesitate to send a message if you need it quickly and I will try to get to it ASAP. -I will combine shipping on multiple auctions. I will send an invoice with updated total at the end of all auctions.-I ONLY ship out of the United States if it through eBay\u2019s International Global Shipping program. Not every country is eligible for this program, so please check with eBay\u2019s policy. If I feel uncomfortable with the transaction, I will cancel and provide a full refund. -Buyer is expected to pay within 3 days upon end of auction. If not paid within this time frame, eBay will automatically open an unpaid claim against the buyer and automatically close in 7 days if payment is not made.-THANK YOU AND HAPPY BIDDING!!!",
