  "Description": "ELEGANCE IN TIME\u00a0-- Hamilton\u2019s Size 12, 910 Pocket Watch was the company\u2019s thinnest, and marketed to gentlemen who didn\u2019t want their watch pockets bulging. The elegant face (an option for the 910) adds the soft sheen of what looks like gold foil pressed with a subtle design. The gold-filled case is wreathed with the Fulton design. This watch\u2019s assembly was completed and sent to Hamilton\u2019s finishing department in Lancaster, PA on July 26, 1921. \u00a0The 910 was produced from 1914 to 1923 for a total run of 153,800, far fewer than many other models. THE CASE: A bit unusual, this case has a snap-off bezel with a full clear lens. The back is hinged and snaps forward revealing a \u201ccurvette\u201d that provides additional protection to the movement. The curvette, also attached to the hinge, snaps out as well revealing both the movement and Hamilton\u2019s 25-year guarantee on the curvette\u2019s inner side. The case number is 316002. THE MOVEMENT: The machinery is made of nickel with 17 jewels to protect the assembly at wear points. The watch is \"adjusted\" to maintain its beat in cold and heat. This particular watch movement was given the serial number 1904798. With the watch shut, the stem winds the mainstream. The hands can be set by lifting the stem and turning the knob in either direction. CONDITION: We have wound and watched this clock. It runs at least a day on a wind-up. Long-term, it may be fast or slow. If so, the adjustment for that is easy to access. Please see the pictures and the condition statement. The back has a three-letter monogram. This item has not been professionally rated, but we believe it to be above average and probably meets the definition of \u201cfine.\u201d OTHER DETAILS: The original, black leather-covered and velvet-lined presentation box is included. In the box is a Hamilton certificate stating the model (Hamilton used the movement \u201cgrade\u201d for model numbers, the serial number and case number. It also states a retail list price of just $43 -- but, of course, back then you could buy a nice new Ford touring car for $595. Notes: Data for this watch largely comes from markings on the watch itself, the Hamilton certificate, an internet site called Pocket Watch Database, several Hamilton company resources, and Hamilton product catalogs from the early 1900s.
