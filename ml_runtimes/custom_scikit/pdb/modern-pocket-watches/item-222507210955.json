ABOUT USWe are a husband and wife team and started selling on eBay in the late 1990's when we had a brick and mortar store. Then around 2003, we sold the business and as a result stopped selling on eBay. In March of 2017, we decided to start our business back but only as an eBay seller. A lot has changed in that long hiatus but we still greatly enjoy finding and selling products to great people such as yourself. If you ever have any questions concerning a product we have or that you are looking for please let us know. We will gladly help you in any way we can.",
