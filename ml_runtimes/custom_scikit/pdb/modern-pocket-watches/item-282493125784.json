  "Description": "Item is in Very Good Condition. If you are a collector and concerned about the condition, please email me for more specifics before you purchase. See Pictures. QUESTIONS: We encourage you to email us with any questions so you are sure that you are getting what you think you are. We promise to try to be as exact in our description as we can, and make the pictures true to life. Our goal is to please, and to turn all of our contacts into satisfied customers that will want to shop with us again. PAYMENT: We request that payment be made within 5 days after the sale is completed. We accept PayPal as our only method of payment. SHIPPING: We ship promptly, usually within 24 hours after payment is received. We ship using USPS Priority as our preferred method since that has proven to be the best method with the least amount of damages being reported. Some listings offer USPS First Class, but please note that FIRST CLASS IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. Since we cannot track nor insure this method, WE WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY RESPONSIBILITY for a package you choose to have shipped this way. If you are buying multiple items, please let us know and do not pay until we send you a combined invoice so we can try to save you some money. If the ad allows for International shipping, just a reminder that all taxes, tariffs, etc. are the responsibility of the buyer. Also we will not mark that this is a gift at zero value, nor will we mark it at a lower cost. RETURNS: We have a return policy as long as we are notified within 30 days of receipt of the package AND you return the item to us in the same package and condition that you received it in. Buyer pays for the return shipping, paid and insured for the full value. IF HOWEVER, IT IS SOMEHOW OUR MISTAKE, then we will promptly refund all your money, including the cost to ship it back, as soon as we receive the package back. Reminder - if we list something as USED, it was previously displayed, repackaged or show slight wear. We will note that as clearly as we can, so you are not disappointed when you receive one of our items. We want repeat business and happy customers!Please be sure to check out our other collectibles in our store \u2013 P and G Collectibles.",
