You can return old batteries, which offer or have offered in our new battery assortment, free of charge to our dispatch warehouse (dispatch address). The symbols showed on the batteries have the following meaning: The symbol of the crossed-out dustbin means that the battery may not be discarded with the household waste. Pb = Battery contains more than 0.004 percent by mass of Lead Cd = Battery contains more than 0.002 percent by mass of Cadmium Hg = Battery contains more than 0.0005 percent by mass of Mercury. Please pay attention to the above instructions. Standard Business Terms and customer information/ Specimen-revocation form / data protection declarationI. Standard business terms \u00a7 1 Basic provisions (1) The following business terms are applicable to all the contracts which you conclude with us as a supplier (Maik Neumann) via the eBay Internet platform. Unless otherwise agreed upon, the inclusion, if necessary, of your own conditions is ruled out. (2) A \u2018consumer\u2019 in the sense of the following regulations is every natural person who concludes a legal transaction which, to an overwhelming extent, cannot be attributed to either his commercial or independent professional activities. The term \u2018businessman\u2019 refers to every natural person, legal person or legally responsible partnership that concludes a legal transaction in pursuance of his/its independent professional or commercial activity. \u00a7 2 Conclusion of the contract (1) The subject-matter of the contract is the selling of products. (2) If we set up an item vis-a-vis eBay, the activation of the supply-side domain at eBay encompasses the binding offer associated with the conclusion of a purchase contract under the conditions specified on the page associated with the item in question. (3) The eBay SBT, especially \u00a7 6, are applicable for concluding the contract; a corresponding link is available below on every eBay page. The contract conclusion is regulated there as follows depending on the offer format: \u201c\u00a7 6 Offer formats and contract conclusion (...) 2. If a seller sets up an item in the auction or fixed-price format using the services of eBay, he makes a binding offer associated with the conclusion of a contract about this item. He thereby determines a start or fixed price and a deadline, within which the offer can be accepted (bidding period). If the seller specifies a minimum price in the auction format, the offer is then under the suspensive condition that the minimum price is reached. 3. The seller can also add a \u201cBuy-now\u201d function to offers in the auction format. This can be exercised by a buyer as long as there was no bidding on the item or a minimum price was not yet reached. eBay reserves the right to change this function in future. (...) 4. In case of fixed price items, the buyer accepts the offer by clicking the \u201cBuy now\u201d button and subsequently confirming the same. In case of fixed price items for which the seller has selected the \u201cImmediate payment\u201d option, the buyer accepts the offer by clicking the \u201cBuy now\u201d button and completing the immediate payment transaction. The buyer can also accept offers for several items by placing the items in the shopping cart (if available) and completing the immediate payment transaction. 5. The buyer accepts the offer through bidding during auctions. The acceptance is done under the suspensive condition that the buyer is the highest bidder at the end of the bidding period. A bid lapses if another buyer makes a higher bid during the bidding period. (...) 6. In case of premature termination of the offer by the seller, a contract is concluded between it and the highest bidder, unless the seller was authorised to withdraw the offer and cancel the existing bids. 7. Buyers can withdraw bids only if there is an authorised reason for it. After an authorised bid withdrawal, no contract is concluded between the user, who is again the highest bidder at the end of the auction owing to the bid withdrawal and the seller. 8. The seller can add a Proposed price function to his offer in certain categories. The Proposed price function allows buyers and sellers to negotiate the price for an item. (...) 11. If an item is deleted from eBay before the expiry of the bidding period, no effective contract is concluded between the buyer and seller.\u201d (4) Purchasing via the \u201cBuy now\u201d or \u201cOffer\u201d function Clicking the \u201cBuy now\u201d or \u201cOffer\u201d button on the item pages still does not result in binding contractual declarations. Rather, you also then have the option to check your entries and rectify them using the \u201cBack\u201d button of the Internet browser or cancel the purchase transaction. This option is no longer available only with the issue of the binding contractual declaration. The menu navigation for eBay that is associated with the execution of a purchase operation specifies the declaration through which you enter into an obligation and the action through which the contract is concluded. (5) Purchase using the shopping cart (if offered) By clicking the \u201cIn den Warenkorb\u201d (\u201cIn the shopping cart\u201d) button provided on the product sites, the items intended for sale are dropped in the \u201cWarenkorb\u201d (\u201cShopping cart\u201d). The \u201cWarenkorb\u201d (\u201cShopping cart\u201d) will be displayed to you subsequently. Furthermore, you can call the \u201cWarenkorb\u201d (\u201cShopping cart\u201d) via the corresponding button in the navigation bar and make changes to it at any point in time. After calling the \u201cWeiter zur Kaufabwicklung\u201d (\u201cProceed to purchase transaction\u201d) and the selection or entry of delivery address and the mode of payment, all order data will once again be displayed on the order overview page. If you select \u201cPayPal\u201d as the type of payment, you will be first led to a login window of PayPal. After a successful login at PayPal, you will be forwarded to the order overview page on eBay. Before submitting the order, you have the option to verify or change (even using the \u201cback\u201d of the Internet browser) all your details once again or to cancel the purchase. By clicking the \u201cKaufen und zahlen\u201d (\u201cPurchase and pay\u201d) button, you declare the acceptance of the offer in a legally binding way, because of which the purchase contract is executed. (6) Purchasing via the \u201cProposed price\u201d function The \u201cProposed price\u201d function makes it possible for you to make us a counter-offer by clicking the \u201cSend proposed price\u201d button on the item page, entering your proposed price on the following page, clicking the \u201cCheck proposed price\u201d button and confirming with the \u201cSend proposed price\u201d button on the following page (binding offer). You are bound to this proposed price for 2 days. The contract is concluded when we accept your proposed price. (7) The execution of the order and the sending of all the details necessitated by the conclusion of the contract take place via e-mail, in a partially-automated manner. Consequently, you have to ensure that the e-mail address that you have deposited with us is the correct one, and that the receipt of the respective e-mails is guaranteed. In particular, you have to ensure that the respective e-mails are not blocked by a SPAM filter. \u00a7 3 Right of retention, reservation of proprietary rights (1) You can only exercise a right of retention if the situation in question involves claims arising from the same contractual relationship. (2) The goods remain our property until the purchase price is paid in full. \u00a7 4 Liability (1) We also provide unlimited liability for damage caused due to the violation of life, limb or health. Furthermore, we provide liability without limitation in all cases of intent and gross negligence, if a defect is fraudulently concealed, in case of assumption of guarantee for the procurement of the object of purchase and in all other legally regulated cases. (2) The liability of defects within the scope of the implied warranty complies with the corresponding regulation in our customer information (Part II). (3) If the situation in question relates to important contractual obligations and involves minor negligence, our liability is limited to the foreseeable damages that are typical for the contract. The term \u2018important contractual obligations\u2019 refers to important obligations that follow from the nature of the contract and whose violation would jeopardise the fulfilment of the purpose of the contract. It also covers obligations that the contents of the contract impose on us in order to facilitate the fulfilment of the purpose of the contract and whose fulfilment makes it possible for the contract to be executed in an orderly manner, and compliance with which may regularly be taken for granted by you. (4) When it comes to the violation of inessential contractual obligations, no liability shall be assumed if the situation in question involves violations of obligations associated with light negligence. (5) The current state of the respective technology makes it impossible to guarantee that data transmission operations that use the internet will take place in an error-free manner characterised by permanent availability. In this respect, we cannot vouch for the constant and uninterrupted availability of the website and the service offered on the website. \u00a7 5 Choice of law (1) German law shall apply. This choice of law only applies to customers if it does not result in the revocation of the protection guaranteed by the mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which the respective customer\u2019s usual place of residence is located (benefit-of-the-doubt principle). (2) The provisions of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods are explicitly inapplicable. _______________________________________________________________________________________ II.

Instructions for revocation Revocation right You have the right to revoke this contract within one month without specifying any reasons.
