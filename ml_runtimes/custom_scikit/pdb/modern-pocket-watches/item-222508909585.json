  "Description": "DESCRIPTION This is a very cool looking vintage Sheffield, Swiss made skeleton pocket watch. It is presently not running. I know nothing about watches so I am just going to tell you what the watch reads. The front reads that it is shock resistant, antimagnetic and Swiss made. The back reads that it is unadjusted, has one jewel. It reads Sheffield Watch Inc, and Swiss made. It measures 1 1/2\" across the front. It has gold numbers; 12, 3, 6, 9 around the clear see through crystal edge and gold line markers for the numbers in between. It has a real nice red enameled second hand. You can see the entire workings of the watch from the back side. The watch appears to be made of brass around the sides and the top loop. I do not see any serial numbers from the outside looking in. I The brass could maybe use a polish. Very interesting looking modernistic time piece. Thanks for looking and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to answer them!
