  "Description": "Striking Al Agnew Signed Wolf Art and Case. QUESTIONS WE GET ASKED: (PLEASE READ) Is the watch genuine or is it a knock-off? I've been collecting watches for over 50 years and during that time we have never sold a phony. I guarantee all brands to be absolutely authentic. Are they used or refurbs? If I say it is new, it\u2019s new. Does it have a new battery and how long will it last? We install a new battery when watch is listed. It can last anywhere from 3-5 years. Or longer. Does the watch come in the original box? Unless we say in the watch description that it does, it does not. If you want it in the original box with all the papers, then you are better off buying from a retailer at a higher price. After all, you wear the watch, not the box. Is it worth the extra $50, or whatever, to have a nice box at home in the dresser? There is no difference in the watch. How can you sell at such a low price? These watches are discontinued models, old store stock, display models, or salesman's samples. We\u2019re retired and do this for a hobby, not as a way to get rich. We have fun and you get the best deal...now there is a WIN-WIN situation!
