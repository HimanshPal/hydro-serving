Terms of Service I expect payment in the form of Pay Pal within 3 days of completion of the auction. I DO TAKE PAY PAL!!! High bidder agrees to pay actual cost of shipping. Actual cost of shipping is not only postage, it is like anything extra like: Bubble wrap, or padded envelopes.I charge a Handling Fee of $6.00 for Domestic/States,this will include insurance and Delivery Confirmation and anything else that is needed,this is for Domestic Buyers Only,International buyers $8.00 handling charge, if you want it insured you will have to go Priority International mail,this is the only way the post office will insure it.

I mainly ship by USPS Priority Mail within the U.S.and Priority International and First Class International. International Buyers \u2013 Please Note: Import duties, taxes and charges are not included in the item price or shipping charges. These charges are the buyer's responsibility. Please check with your country's customs office to determine what these additional costs will be prior to bidding/buying. Other information include: These charges are normally collected by the delivering freight (shipping) company or when you pick the item up \u2013 do not confuse them for additional shipping charges. We do not mark merchandise values below value or mark items as \"gifts\" - US and International government regulations prohibit such behavior. Multiple wins will save considerable $ on shipping! NOTE: If you do not like my shipping and handling cost Please DO NOT BID! I get people bid and then leave feedback that the shipping and handling is high so I would rather you not bid at all because when you click and bid you say you agree to everything in my auction,I am not saying this to be mean,just want to make sure if you bid you are agreeing to everything,that's why at the beginning of description,it say(Please Read EVERY THAT IS WRITTEN BEFORE YOU BID!) Feedback I post feedback when I receive payment, and I ship product as soon as possible within a day up to three days.
