If you want it faster, contact us for a quote before purchasing or placing bids.<| Items are well packaged for shipment.<| Please check email/eBay messages regularly and respond promptly if contacted. It can help prevent delays.FEEDBACK<| Feedback is important. Please provide a 5-Star feedback rating on eBay for us. If you don\u2019t feel that you can, please contact us before providing neutral or negative feedback so we can hopefully reach a solution or resolve any problems or concerns beforehand.RETURNSAllowable Returns for: -Blatant/Glaring Description Misrepresentations -Wrong Item Shipped -Broken/Damaged Item During Shipment<| These categories are currently our allowable returns due to our shipping and other costs. But, we will try to work with customers on a case-by-case basis as much as we can.<| All returns for your money-back refund (credited back to your billing account via eBay) must be pre-approved and we must have the item back (when requested) in our possession before you\u2019re refunded\u2014sorry, no exchanges or replacements.<| Returned items must be in the exact same resalable shape as originally mailed out (see: http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/return-item-condition.html) except of course items damaged during shipment\u2014where we\u2019ll expect and need your cooperation.<| We must be contacted within 3 days after you receive an allowable return item (based on tracking) that you wish to return it, and then please await our reply. Then you have 14 days for the return (runs concurrently). The faster the process is completed successfully, the faster you\u2019ll get your refund.<| Return shipping costs (incl. add-ons) are generally the responsibility of the buyer when it is not an allowable return as listed above and you might be responsible for paying the initial outgoing shipping as well.

Of course, props aren\u2019t part of any sale.<| We\u2019re always willing to work with our customers as much as possible! Our return policy is basically to account for our unintentional but major oversights/errors, which is only right. Normal, common, minor oversights, small errors, tiny omissions, etc. on our part do not usually fall within our allowable returns\u2019 categories\u2014we\u2019re all too prone to make those too regularly and time is always a restraint, especially when describing an item (can\u2019t write a book on each item). <| When something is important enough to you that you might want to return an item for that reason and if that information isn\u2019t addressed properly in our description, then please contact us and ask questions about it before bidding or buying! Have your questions/concerns addressed before bidding or buying. Please help us to help you buy with confidence.<| Your cooperation is very much appreciated. Remember to contact us if you have any questions or need help in any way. No question is a dumb question. It it\u2019s on your mind before bidding or buying, please ask about it. Sincerely, thank you in advance and Happy Shopping!!! <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>------------------------------------------------<\\ /> This store is in memory of our kind and loving Mom who passed away on November 27, 2014, Thanksgiving Day. She liked our idea of having the ability to sell items online. But unfortunately, we weren\u2019t able to get this store \u2018off-the-ground\u2019 due to the extensive one-on-one care that we needed to provide for her (24/7 full-time care-giving for years). However, we know that she would be very happy that it is up and running now! Thank you Mom for everything! We will always miss you!\u2026.Always cherish your loved ones\u2014you never know how long they will be with you. <\\ />",

    "Description": "Please see \u201cBASIC POLICIES, INFORMATION, and EXPLANATIONS\u201d in the listing\u2019s description for detailed information about our store\u2019s Return Policy and other information.\n\nBecause some items are preset in eBay\u2019s drop-down windows, the \u2018request to return\u2019 time for our store is actually three regular days and not 14, although we do have a 14-day window that runs concurrently for you to return an item once it has been pre-approved for a return that qualifies under our store\u2019s categories for returns.\n\nFurthermore, eBay\u2019s drop-down window for who pays return postage doesn\u2019t leave room for discussions. It\u2019s either the buyer or the seller. Although we chose the buyer as being responsible, in reality, this is something that will probably be based on a return\u2019s circumstances and the discussion that we and the buyer will need before any item is approved for return.\n\nThe drop-down window has \u2018money back\u2019 as the refund, which is probably correct except that it is done through eBay\u2019s online refund process that probably credits the buyer\u2019s method-of-payment. We just wanted to point these items out since they\u2019re explained more in our store\u2019s policies.\n\nCurrently, we\u2019re not charging a restocking fee, but if it becomes necessary, we might have too.  We like to think of our customers as our friends and hopefully you will feel the same about us.\n\nWe will try to make your buying experience a pleasant one and uphold our end to the best that we can (and hopefully you\u2019ll want to shop with us again), but we\u2019ll need your cooperation too. Please feel free to contact us with any questions at any time\u2014we\u2019ll be glad to respond.\n\nThank you for your understanding. Best Wishes and Happy Shopping!!! :-)",
