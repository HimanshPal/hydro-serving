Broadway Limited Here we have a Langendorf Watch Co., model \"Broadway Limited\" open-faced pocketwatch housed in a gold filled case from (we believe) the 1930s. The watch is powered by a 21 Jewel Broadway Limited movement with a swan's neck micrometer regulator, rose gold wheels, and rose gold bezel set jewels, marked adjusted to 2 positions. The watch features a 50.27mm gold filled case with a wonderfully decorated caseback. The monogram crest has never been engraved and it comes with its original \"real\" glass crystal. The GF case looks great given its age. The white enamel dial features bold Arabic markers with red accents every 5 minutes. It also features bold blued steel hands. Overall the watch looks great, certainly better than most considering its age. At around 80 years old and still running, still doing its job and looking good. It's a nice quality timepiece! We've wound the watch and it's been keeping good time over the last 24 hours, though we're unsure of its service history. You may want to have it serviced at some point in order to ensure longterm reliable timekeeping. Please view photos carefully before purchasing, as photos are a part of the description.
