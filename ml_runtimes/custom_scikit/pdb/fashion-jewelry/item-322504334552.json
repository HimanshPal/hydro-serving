My family has been involved in the realm of handicrafts for many years now. I was barely 17 years old when I realized I was completely immersed in the creation of handcrafted pieces, including sandalwood and brass items and jewelry, among others. Lately, I have been much more involved in the design of jewelry. I'm inspired by nature hence you will find that most of my jewelry items feature natural motifs. My journey into handicrafts has been great, yet the highlight came in 1995, when the Sultan of Brunei placed an order for my designs! It was time bound, it took me and my artisan collaborators about two months to complete the order. All in all, it was a really exciting experience to be working all together. I always strive to improve designs and quality, and demand for my products has steadily increased. I hope and wish that my association with Novica will bring new opportunities.... Product Features An original NOVICA fair trade product in association with National Geographic. Includes an official NOVICA Story Card certifying quality & authenticity.
