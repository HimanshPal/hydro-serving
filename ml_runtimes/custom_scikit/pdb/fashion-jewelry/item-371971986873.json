  "Description": "This dragonfly pin is pre-owned yet in excellent condition. Please refer to the pictures for measurements. The pin originally sold on QVC as item #J-155838 and is no longer available. Below is a description of the pin from their website. The pin weighs 1 oz. and will ship first class. \"Symbolic of the power and poise that comes from experience, the dragonfly is beautifully rendered in this mosaic pin. The wings, spread wide, stand out in shades of blue, purple, black, and rose epoxy enamel, frosted with glitter--plus a green, emerald-cut crystal at the tips. The head, body, and antennae display round crystals in fuchsia, green aurora borealis, teal, light green, orange, yellow, pink, and clear. Oxidized copper-colored finishStandard bar pin and catchMeasures approximately 2-3/4\"L x 4-1/4\"WMade in Thailand\"All items are from a smoke-free environment. If I receive them and they have an odor it is pointed out in the description of the item. I combine all multiple winning bids to save on shipping. Just wait for a revised invoice. If you don\u2019t receive one in a timely manner email me, I may not have realized there were multiple wins. Please be considerate and pay immediately after the bidding is over. Waiting a week to 10 days, without letting me know, is not an A in my buyers\u2019 grade book. About Me: I have been an eBay member since the about 2003. At that time I started selling off some of my Dad\u2019s collectibles after he passed. Here and there I find some items to purchase for myself. Since retiring in 2014 from 33.5 yrs of teaching, I have been filling my time helping friends declutter their houses by selling items for them. They get to clear out their unwanted items and I get to save our earnings for monthly \u201cGirls\u2019 Night Out\u201d which is when we get together to have dinner at some local fine dining restaurant. It is a win-win. It is a hobby I enjoy without leaving the comfort of my home and we get a night out for good food and wine. Feedback: Please leave positive feedback and I will do the same for you. Since I began selling on eBay as a hobby back in 2003, I have worked very hard over the years to make sure all eBayers are happy with their purchases. My feedback speaks for itself. I do NOT consider myself an expert in any one category. However, I research and try to be as accurate as possible when posting a listing. Nobody is perfect. If you find errors in a listing or if you are an unhappy buyer, please let me know. If you absolutely LOVE an item, I really enjoy hearing about it and would wel",
