Most of my pictures are taken with a magnifying lens giving me clear, close up photos. This tends to also magnify minor flaws on item which many times cannot be seen on actual item. I strive to describe all of my items as accurately and honestly as possible however as all items are pre-owned and vintage in nature, minor scratches and wear is possible. Items and colors may also look a bit different due to different monitor's colors and width. Vintage items are a piece of history and always in style. Offering styles and construction that cannot be duplicated today, buying vintage is a wonderful way to \"Go Green\" by recycling treasures from yesterday to brighten our today. USA Shipping Only!
