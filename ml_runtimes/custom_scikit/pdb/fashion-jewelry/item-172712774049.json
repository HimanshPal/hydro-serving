  "Description": "\"AFRICAIN\" CLIP ON EARRINGS. \u2028These are gorgeous. One of Pavone's earlier designs. A pair of clip earrings, hand painted in the ancient Assyrian style. The Modernist look Pavone has given them makes them very stylish. Part of a set which I am listing separately. Buy the full set and get a 10% discount on the total. Just ask for an invoice before paying. This listing is for the earrings only. They are good collectors items from the early years of this popular artist. They are all from my own collection. Good condition. Signed. Size...7.5cm drop from top of button X 4.5 wide. APPROXIMATELY. \u2028 All of my pieces are original. They come direct from Pavone's studio in France. I have known Marie Christine for many years and collected many lovely pieces over that time. Her work is unique. It is largely cut from old Galalith (not moulded). It is then dyed to get the great colours she is known for, hand made, hand painted, polished and glazed. This makes each piece it's own little work of art. In a world of laser cut mass production, it is rare to find someone committed to making everything by hand. \u2028 Thanks for looking... Don't forget to check my other items.",
