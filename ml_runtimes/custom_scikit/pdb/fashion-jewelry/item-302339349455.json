  "Description": "Product Information Peacock Eyeglass Holder Wooden Sculpture Home Decor Gift Stand Bedroom Accent The eyeglass holder, featured in a playful peacock shape will add a uniquely interesting piece to your home. Place glasses over the friendly little peacocks eyes and secure in notch for stylish safekeeping. Hand-carved from sustainable Indian Rosewood by artisans in villages in north central India. Story Behind the Art: The traditional craft of woodcarving plays an important role for many Muslim artisan communities in small towns and agricultural villages in north central India. Each artisan uses hand tools to skillfully carve blocks of sustainable Indian Rosewood into fine treasures. This art form requires mastery to create the intricate carving, filigree and inlay work. Many of the patterns are deeply influenced by cultural motifs from Muslim dynasties that ruled the region centuries ago. Artisans finish and detail each item with natural wax and non-toxic paints. In the northwestern desert of India, three artisan cooperatives make traditional arts by hand. When the area was devastated by an earthquake in 2001, these artisans needed help rebuilding their lives. Thankfully, handmade expressions could help. Handmade expressions is a sourcing partner for socially and environmentally responsible products. Working with the artisans in India, they strive to improve the artisans\u2019 economic conditions and social standing while also encouraging them to use recycled materials and natural fibers. Handmade expressions goes the extra step to inform the artisans about global fashion and market trends, so these local artists are able to produce goods that are desirable and contemporary.
