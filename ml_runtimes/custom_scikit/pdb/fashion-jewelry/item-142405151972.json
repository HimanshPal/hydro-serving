Large at 3 1/2\" long by 2 3/4\" wide at widest. NO RETURNS PLEASE NOTE: I am helping a parent with Alzheimer's. I try to ship the same day payment is received, but occasionally there may be a day delay, with notice, if an \"emergency\" arises. I ask for your understanding when this happens. I have retired and am selling most of my personal jewelry and accessories. Please check back often as I have a lot, and I am slow. Thanks I Combine Shipping. Consider photos part of description.
