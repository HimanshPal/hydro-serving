Are your products real gold and real silver? While our fashion jewelry may look like real gold and silver jewelry pieces, they are actually gold plated, gold tone, silver plated or silver tone and are not real gold /silver fine jewelry. From time time, we may carry 925 sterling silver jewelry, and it would be stated as so in the product description. Most of our silver tone and gold tone jewelry is made from a base metal core with a gold, silver or a rhodium finish. The result is an outstanding simulated product that looks and feels like real solid gold or silver jewelry, but at a much lower cost to you. Now you can shop smart and look like a million bucks. Will my gold plated jewelry fade? Fashion jewelry is a sensible alternative to real solid gold jewelry. However, all gold plated and gold tone costume jewelry eventually wears and will show the base metal underneath. Depending on how often you wear it, gold plated jewelry can last years. However, if you wear the jewelry on a daily basis over bare skin and you don't clean the jewelry, you can expect the plating to last up to possibly six months. The type of jewelry and how it is worn will affect how long it will last. A jewelry piece that is always worn next to the skin will wear off quicker than one worn over clothing. Grillz can be rinsed off after each use and chains can be wiped clean of any sweat and body oils, to maximize the life of your hip hop jewelry. Hip Hop Grillz Why buy grillz from us? We know that you have many choices when it comes to buying grillz. Rest assured, when you purchase grillz from us, you are getting a solid quality product.
