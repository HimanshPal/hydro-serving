  "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": "false",
  "BidCount": "0",
  "Description": "This outstanding Kirks Folly hair comb is black featuring black velvet! This piece has been in storage and NEVER BEEN WORN. The comb measures approximately 4.25 inches in width. One tooth sticks up a litte more than the others...see photos. This is a rare and gorgeous piece. A PERFECT GIFT! The hair comb is part of a collection that was recently acquired from a jewelry store that was closing. The owner of the store was an avid Kirks Folly collector and she had MANY rare pieces purchased directly through a personal arrangement she had with the Kirk Family here in Rhode Island. The collection includes modern & vintage items. Many of the vintage items were unworn & had been stored for many years on the original card. SHIPPING:Combined shipping discounts are available. Please contact us prior to paying for a corrected invoice. If you pay prior to receiving your invoice, we may not be able to discount shipping for you. International Buyers \u2013 Please Note:Import duties, taxes, and charges are not included in the item price or shipping cost. These charges are the buyer's responsibility.
