HOW TO CARE FOR YOUR NEW JEWELRYHere are some tips I have learned thru out the years (this is good advice for all jewelry types):\u00b7 Never force open lever backs of new earrings. Gently and slowly open back lever of earrings. You can do this a few times to loosen them up.\u00b7 Always keep your jewelry either in boxes or plastic small \u201ccraft\u201d bags. This keeps jewelry from bumping into each other thereby increasing possibility of losing stones.\u00b7 NEVER put perfume on over your jewelry.\u00b7 Don\u2019t drop your jewelry! This jarrs the jewelry and could loosen a stone and eventually loosing one. \u00b7 LOVE AND ENJOY YOUR NEW JEWELRY! PAYMENT POLICY: You may pay via Paypal. All major credit cards accepted. Unless making multiple purchases, payment will be due within 3 days of auction close. SHIPPING TERMSDOMESTIC SHIPPING:IF YOU PURCHASE MULTIPLE JEWELRY PIECES FROM ME ($100.00 +), THEY CAN ALL BE SHIPPED IN U.S.P.S. PRIORITY MAIL SMALL FLAT RATE BOX AND AS LONG AS THEY ALL FIT.

DOMESTIC SHIPPING: FREE FIRST CLASS SHIPPING WITH TRACKING INFORMATION OR $7.15 PRIORITY MAIL SMALL FLAT RATE BOX WITH TRACKING INFORMATION. I DO COMBINE SHIPMENTS WHEN POSSIBLE. IF YOU DO BUY MULTIPLE ITEMS, PLEASE DO NOT PAY FROM EBAY INVOICE. I WILL SEND YOU AN INVOICE AT END OF YOUR LAST AUCTION WIN COMBINING SHIPMENT CHARGES. ALL JEWELRY COMES IN A GIFT BOX WHICH IS WHY I PREFER TO SHIP U.S.P.S. PRIORITY MAIL, AND IT KEEPS JEWELRY SAFE FROM DAMAGE THAT MIGHT OCCUR WHILE IN TRANSIT.
