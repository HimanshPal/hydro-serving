  "Description": "Save on shipping You MUST first add items to your eBay Shopping Cart to purchase multiple items with a single payment and receive a shipping discount.International Buyers \u2013 Please Note: Import duties, taxes and charges are not included in the item price or shipping charges. These charges are the buyer's responsibility. Please check with your country's customs office to determine what these additional costs will be prior to bidding/buying These charges are normally collected by the delivering freight (shipping) company or when you pick the item up \u2013 do not confuse them for additional shipping charges. We do not mark merchandise values below value or mark items as \"gifts\" - US and International government regulations prohibit such behavior. **Unlike most of my lady face pins, this one is Bisque Porcelain instead of porcelain-look resin. This is an original, handcrafted pin signed by the artist, Linda Rosshirt (me). The BISQUE PORCELAIN face is already painted and I embellish to create the pin\u2019s own distinct look. As I add hats, hair, jewelry and/or fur, each pin develops her own personality that I try to convey in the finished piece. Great attention is given to detail to make each pin a unique work. These pins wear as well with your favorite faded jeans as they do your Sunday best. I like to dress them up with exotic, romantic or mod looks and wear the one that best fits my mood. So, add a dash of panache to a coat, dress or blouse. Dress up a jacket, brighten a vest and lift your spirits! I hope you have as much fun wearing as I do creating them. This pin\u2019s individual attributes are: Type of face:PORCELAIN full face viewApproximate size of pin: 2 3/4\" L x 2 3/4\" W Main colors used: green, beige, goldDescription: Her eyes are a soft blue with gold eye shadow and she wears pink lipstick. Her deeply-cuffed green taffeta hat has a piece of peacock feather and two ribbon roses. She wears a green carved brooch (I think it is jade, but not sure) at the center of her genuine beige mink wrap. A tiny vintage pair of gold tone, rhinestone-studded cat eye glasses complete her glamourous look. Please browse my eBay store for a large variety of pins & other jewelry, accessories and miscellaneous items of interest. I want you to be happy with your purchase(s). Please send me an email if there is a problem. I will work with you to resolve any issue and/or refund purchase price. I am happy to answer questions that you have before and after purchase.
