  "Description": "I am downsizing and selling all my personally collections! I have personally acquired this from Europe.Guaranteed 100% authentic Michaela Frey royal clasp bangle in the most beautiful enamel with 24K accents from their famous \"Greco-Roman\" collection in the \"Aphrodite\" design.According to the legends of Homer and Hesiod, Aphrodite (\"Venus\" in Roman mythology), Greek goddess of love and beauty and the daughter of Zeus, was born from the foam of the sea. She is the symbol for BEAUTY, LOVE and also FERTILITY. Her she is represented as a scallop shell, the symbol used by Sandro Botticelli (among others) in his masterwork, \"Birth of Venus\".The meander - an ancient ornamental labyrinth-like motif symbolizing immortal beauty and harmony - borders the scallop shell form. The enamel has handcrafted 24K yellow gold application set in white gold-plated mounting. This is a royal clasp bangle or click-clac snap close bangle bracelet. The bangle front measures about 7/8 inch (2.2 cm) wide. This is a MEDIUM (M): 1-7/8 inches (4.8 cm) by 2-3/8 inches (6 cm) inside space.Stamping on the inside is \"M. Frey Wille\" with its lion logo.Condition is brand new and it has never been worn. The white gold plated mounting is shiny as shown. It will come with Frey Wille blue suede box as shown.
