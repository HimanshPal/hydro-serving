  "Description": "\"AFRICAIN\" FEMALE HEAD BROOCH. \u2028This is a lovely piece. One of Pavone's earlier pieces. It is a beautifully painted female head in the ancient Assyrian style. The Modernist look makes it very stylish. It is part of a set, which I am listing separately. If you buy the 3 lot set, I will give a10% discount on the total. Just ask for an invoice before paying. They are good collectors items from the early years of this popular artist. From my own collection. This listing is for one item only. Good condition. Signed. Size 7cm x 6cm APPROXIMATELY. \u2028 All of my pieces are original. They come direct from Pavone's studio in France. I have known Marie Christine for many years and collected many lovely pieces over that time. Her work is unique. It is largely cut from old Galalith (not moulded). It is then dyed to get the great colours she is known for, hand made, hand painted, polished and glazed. This makes each piece it's own little work of art. In a world of laser cut mass production, it is rare to find someone committed to making everything by hand. \u2028 Thanks for looking... Don't forget to check my other items.",
