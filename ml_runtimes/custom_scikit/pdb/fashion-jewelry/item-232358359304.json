  "Description": "Crossover Symmetry Crossover Cords 2.0 Description Crossover Symmetry Crossover Cords 2.0 The Crossover Cords 2.0 are custom made for the Crossover Symmetry programs with quality, safety and performance in mind. After thousands of hours of testing and improving all internal components, Crossover Symmetry is proud to announce that the 2.0 cords are here and ready to go where no cord has gone before. They have been independently tested to last over 15 times longer than the previous model. Crossover Symmetry is so confident in the new 2.0 cords that they have extended the manufacturer's warranty period from 6 months to 2 years! Safety should be a primary concern when using exercise cords. Instead of a broken cord flying at your face like a sling shot, the cord is contained inside of the nylon safety sleeve. The sleeve also protects the high-grade latex tubing from UV rays, over-stretching and abrasions that can reduce its lifespan. The Crossover Cords 2.0 feature a unique handle to carabiner configuration allowing for easy setup on a chain link fence or using the CS Door Belts\u2122, Crossover SRS\u2122, or CS Wall Mounts\u2122. Crossover Cords are sold in pairs.
