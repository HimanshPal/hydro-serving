  "Title": "Huge Sterling Silver .925 Fashion Jewelry Lot (40) Pearl Diamond Marcasite",
  "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": "false",
  "BidCount": "0",
  "Description": "This is a huge lot of 40 pieces sterling silver fashion jewelry. The necklace sets (2) are counting as one piece each. This lot includes all pieces marked Sterling silver or stamped .925. I have not tested them I just went by the markings. There is a genuine pearl necklace (tested by rubbing against teeth and they feel rough and my dealer said they are real), a pendant with a diamond that has been tested by my diamond selector II, mother of pearl earrings, black onyx ring, rhinestones, enamel, Beads, crystal and a pendant that is marcasite and I think a pair of earrings with peridot stones. Three out of the four rings are bent as can be seen from the photos but should easily be fixed. I believe the bear in the bead necklace set is the only silver piece in that set, it is marked. The rings are sizes 5, 6, 71/2, and 8. All of the pieces I went over briefly with a silver cleaner rag but I highly recommend cleaning them more to bring them back to their shine. I did not clean the earrings in the little box because they are sealed. The earrings are for pierced except for one pair which is a clip on (leaf earrings and heart earrings). There is a pair of gold plated sterling silver earrings with what I believe to be peridot stones. I believe the only silver part of the multi-colored cancer bracelet is the ribbon. All pieces are marked either sterling written out or stamped .925. There are more markings but I have not taken the time to see what they are and who they are. The pieces are either silver sterling silver or gold plated over sterling silver. I took photos of the jewelry on the scale both I grams and ounces. The weight does not include the bead necklace with the bear since the bear is the only thing silver nor does it include the earrings in the box because they are sealed. Please note this lot is sold as is. I believe all pieces are in great wearable condition. Some are older but still great and all pieces are pre-owned and may shows signs or use, wear or age. If there is anything wrong with the an item that I've seen I have taken a photo so you can see it prior to purchase. Please see the photos as they are part of the description and condition of the items. Be sure to view our other items in our store. Thank you for viewing.",
