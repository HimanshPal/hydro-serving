Get Vendio Gallery - Now FREE! ~~~Welcome to My Store! ~~~ Be sure to check out my ME page for info on my stores and my blog Item Description This listing is for one stunning large French barrette from CACHE (yes from that luxury store in the mall). It is made from a silver metal and adorned with clear rhinestones in a triple rose pattern. There is a Cache bag that is included, this is a long retired item. The retail on this was $48.00 plus tax. The barrette measures 3 1/4 inches long by 1 5/8 inches wide and sits 5/8 of an inch high. It has a graceful head hugging curve and the barrette mechanism is a French clasp- meaning it is self-adjusting (not made in France). Brand new and sent boxed for protection.
