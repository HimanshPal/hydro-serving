I report and block all nonpaying members. Please do not make a best offer if you do not intend on paying once accepted. My rules on this are firm because of several non-payers in the past.

I also occasionally send gifts to my repeat customers with their orders. I take care of and appreciate my customers! My items are authentic and at some point have been a part of my collection/closet. Some Origami Owl items may come with non-Origami Owl pieces because they are theme-inspired, however that would be explicitly stated so in the listing. My items come from a non-smoking, but pet friendly home. Please note that pets are not allowed near any merchandise. Paypal only\u263a Shipping Information Orders are usually shipped within 24 hours, with tracking information. I ship to the buyer\u2019s Paypal confirmed address only. I include signature confirmation for items totaling in $130+ for free however, if your item is less and you would like signature confirmation I can do this at an additional cost. Once an item is shipped it is the post office\u2019s responsibility to deliver it to you in the condition and time-frame that I sent it. If problems arise due to the post office\u2019s negligence I will work with you to figure it out. Juicy Couture jewelry will ship in Juicy Couture jewelry boxes only if I explicitly state so in the listing. This is the same for Origami Owl items. I re-inspect and photograph all items prior to shipping. If issues arise on my end I will contact you prior to shipping. I take pride in my shipping process and how securely I package my items. No international shipping for most items right now. Juicy Couture Charms and Care Guide I would like to start off by saying that I do not work for nor represent any of the name brands that I sell. I just enjoy their items. With that said I love Juicy Couture Charms! I purchased my very first charm in 2010, began collecting charms in 2012, and today my collection just keeps on growing! Juicy Couture began manufacturing charms in 2004 and stopped in 2014 \u2013 making all of their full-sized charms retired. Within that decade they created hundreds upon hundreds of charms. The made individual charms, boxed charm sets, charms as pendants and prefixed charm bracelets. Some were limited edition, or only available or a short period of time, and some are just incredibly rare and coveted by all collectors. Know your charms. It is best practice to be knowledgeable about what you want before you purchase it. If you have any questions about any charm, even if I do not have it for sale, feel free to message me. I am always down to talk charms! CHARM CARE: Although some charms can be very pricey and others very affordable, the one thing that most of them have in common is that they are technically costume jewelry. Except in a few cases, the vast majority of the time Juicy jewelry, is either gold or silver plated. Nevertheless, it still must be treated with care because it is extremely delicate. I\u2019ve seen charms with missing stones, chipped/peeled/blotched paint, missing/broken parts, tarnish and patina etc. Here are a few tips to help you better care for your Juicy jewelry. People mainly for collect charms for three different reasons: to wear them, the display them or to \u201cplay\u201d with them. My suggestion is to only display your charms so that they maintain their original condition and value. There are many ways to display your charms, but my biggest suggestion is to put them in a charm holding case so that them can lay flat. Hanging charms makes them susceptible to gravity and can cause pulling and the loosing of lids. From my experience charms with lids loosen over time, eventually to the point where they don\u2019t stay closed. Unfortunately, this is common. Wearing charms leaves them open to damage such as missing stones and chipped paint. If you are going to wear your charms be mindful while doing so. Also never, never, never, spray your jewelry with perfume \u2013 this daily practice can cause extreme tarnish to the jewelry. Do not wear your charms in water or while sleeping. Only spot clean \u2013 if needed your local jeweler could probably recommend a cleaner. Take care of these little treasures! Happy Charming!!!!",
