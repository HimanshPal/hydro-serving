  "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": "false",
  "Location": "Greenville, New York",
  "Description": "Estate find. Mixed lot of some vintage, retro and more recent pieces of costume jewelry. There is a mix of styles, materials and finished. Some Are rhinestone vintage pieces, some glass beads, natural materials, plastic,...Age unknown. The lot includes: 32 pairs of earrings5 rings15 pins/brooches 34 bracelets46 necklaces2 bow ties10 misc. pieces like charms, pendants, etc....Some are marked with maker's names, most are unmarked. All look to be in wearable condition. I would suggest light cleaning on all pieces. Several might show some age and wear, but still fine to use (in my opinion) I do remember that there is 1 or 2 rhinestone missing, but other then that I did not see broken pieces.This lot includes 144 pieces total. It is sold in as is, as pictured condition. Please look over all pictures for more details, as they are a big part of my description. Total weight is just about 7 lbs.This lot will be shipped free within USA, via the least expensive shipping option.
