  "Description": "This stunning Kirks Folly brooch/pin/pendant is silver tone and features a delicate snowflake design accented with many clear crystals. It measures approximately 2 3/8 inches by 2 inches. The back of the pin is not signed, but it is new on the original card. This piece is part of a collection that was recently acquired from a jewelry store that was closing. The owner of the store was an avid Kirks Folly collector and she had MANY rare pieces purchased directly through a personal arrangement she had with the Kirk Family here in Rhode Island. The collection includes modern & vintage items. Many of the vintage items were unworn & had been stored for many years on the original card. SHIPPING:Combined shipping discounts are available.
