  "Description": "Arabian Knight Sultan pin/brooch, enamel and rhinestones. This is a unique pin! Our proud looking Arabian man is holding a shiny silver tone sword or dagger. His eyes stand out with the large, blue colored rhinestones. The pin is textured, and accented in the shiny gold on his hat, clothes and upturned sippers ......very pretty! His shirt is all white rhinestones. The turban is dark blue and green stripes of enamel that match his jacket and belt. It is topped with a red cabochon glass stone. The pin is 1 3/4\" long. This would be a nice addition to your jewelry collection, or would make a cute gift for the cat fan. Colors may vary on individual computers, and PHOTOS ARE LARGER THAN THE ORIGINAL ITEM in order to show detail. Thanks for looking!
