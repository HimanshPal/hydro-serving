Please read\u2026 I will always have fun vintage items posted for auction or buy it now listed and will gladly combine shipping so please check out my other items. I also list NEW ITEMS at discount prices. As with almost ALL items we sell, this item is sold in used vintage condition which means by nature it is not perfect as it is a pre-owned and will show signs of wear, use, and age. It is not in new condition nor is it mint. We do not clean, repair, or polish items, we sell them as we find them. It is sold 'as is.' We work VERY HARD to describe each item in detail, including its imperfections. Our assessment of condition may differ from yours, this is the nature of buying something online/through the mail. Please ask questions prior to bidding (not after) as we conduct true auctions or in some cases BUY IT NOW where sales are final, no returns, no refunds, no partial refunds or returns. Please note: I do not accept returns\u2026all items are sold \u201cAs Is\u201d so please ask questions if you have them. I will answer promptly\u2026Though I don\u2019t expect any issues to arise during the transaction\u2026please communicate with me if they do. Prompt payment is appreciated and so is feedback (please don\u2019t forget) I strive for 5 star excellence for every sale on eBay. If you are not satisfied with this transaction please be sure to email and let me know. A 5 star rating helps keep our eBay cost down which allows me to pass the savings along to you-our customers! ATTENTION INTERNATIONAL BUYERS, USPS packages can take 4 to 6 sometimes even 8 weeks to arrive at final destination, this is out of my control and I ask for you to please be patient, also I am not responsible for any customs tax applied by your country, this is your responsibility as the buyer.
