  "Description": "ALL REASONABLE OFFERS CONSIDERED ....INCLUDES FREE SHIPPING A picture is worth a thousand words, so please be sure to see all pictures! It is our family teams desire to accurately describe our items, so pictures and display models are considered an integral part of the description but NOT an indication of the size. Please read the written description for dimensions and weight. We have several team members that are studying gemstone identification and we test all of our gemstones with a PRESIDUM GEM TESTER to determine the type of stone or rhinestone (glass), but we cannot state on most stones which are man-made or natural from the earth - only a license gemologist can do that. Please be advised by law we should not say \"Cubic Zirconia\" unless it is hallmarked as such. Dimensions, size and weights, if any are given, are APPROXIMATE. Unmarked solid gold and sterling silver is always acid tested for content. Everything is inspected with a jeweler's loupe due to our items being pre-owned - vintage, so please expect normal wear, unless otherwise stated in the auction. We very much appreciate your business and we thank everyone for buying from STERLING ROSE ESTATE GALLERY.You are a blessing to our team! Thank you for shopping with THE STERLING ROSE ESTATE GALLERY, we are glad you are here! Please take the time to read our complete listing terms agreement. We try to provide a very detailed description, so you can buy with confidence. If there is still something you are not sure about, please feel free to contact us with any questions or comments you may have at THE STERLING ROSE ESTATE GALLERY 24 hours daily through the eBay message board. We here at THE STERLING ROSE ESTATE GALLERY want you to be happy with your purchase. Please mark us in your favorites, as we are always traveling from estate to estate in the U.S.A. purchasing. If there is a certain piece of jewelry you are looking for, please advise us. We have several venues that we sell from and could have your prized piece in that store - or at least be on the lookout for your item in our travels across the States.Most items are cleaned and polished to a degree to look almost brand new. Deep cleaning is left up to the buyer on some items. Vintage Sterling Silver Jewelry may have the patina left in place.RING SIZING AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST, price depends on the degree of work preformed, non refundable.All items will come in a clean new box. All earrings will have matching sterling backs, most new. link to STONES COLOR MEANING click here link to STONE MEANING click here link to RING CONVERSION CHART click here - add 1/2 size for wide rings.Vermeil: (Pronounced: Vermay) is sterling silver that has been gold-plated. Most of our vermeil is plated with 10K-24K gold. This is a good combination for those with allergy to normal, plated jewelry items. The difference between vermeil, and gold-filled, is in the thickness of the gold and the base metal used. In vermeil, the base is sterling silver. To be considered vermeil, the gold must be at least 10 carat (42%) and be at least 2.5 micrometers thick.Gold-plated: A base metal such as steel or brass is dipped into a bath of electroplating solution, with a lump of solid gold. When an electric current is applied, a thin layer of gold is deposited on the metal. Since the plating is quite thin, the plate (and hence the color) on findings can wear off. There will be none of these items on this site. Sterling Silver: is a mixture of pure silver and some other metal, usually copper through out the item. The resulting alloy gives the silver strength. The standard is at least 92.5% silver. Hence the .925 stamp you see on some sterling silver items. Most sterling silver items without a non-tarnishing coat can be buffed out to look as brand new, just like real gold can - as seen in a jewelry store front. Gold-filled: also called rolled-gold. These jewelry items are not actually filled with gold. They are made of a base metal (usually brass or copper) covered by sheets of gold in a mechanical bonding process. Effectively a thick coat of gold: the gold content is 5% or 1/20 of the total weight. Use gold-filled items for your top-of-the-line jewelry. Usually made with 14k gold, it is hard wearing. With reasonable care it will not peel or flake, and should last as long as solid 14k gold jewelry. It is safe for most people with sensitive skin. However, there will be none of those items on this site. See my other listings for more great items! Payment PAYPAL ONLY WITHIN THREE (3) DAYS.
