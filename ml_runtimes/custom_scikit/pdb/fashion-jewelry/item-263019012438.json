  "Title": "Vintage KIRKS FOLLY Nude Angel In Flight Cherub Clear Crystal Silver Pin RARE 6V",
  "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": "false",
  "BidCount": "0",
  "Description": "This stunning Kirks Folly pin is silver tone (appears rhodium plated) and features an angel in flight with wings detailed in clear crystals. It measures approximately 2.25 inches by 1.25 inches. This is a gorgeous and rare treasure!!! This piece is part of a collection that was recently acquired from a jewelry store that was closing. The owner of the store was an avid Kirks Folly collector and she had MANY rare pieces purchased directly through a personal arrangement she had with the Kirk Family here in Rhode Island. The collection includes modern & vintage items. Many of the vintage items were unworn & had been stored for many years on the original card. SHIPPING:Combined shipping discounts are available. Please contact us prior to paying for a corrected invoice. If you pay prior to receiving your invoice, we may not be able to discount shipping for you. International Buyers \u2013 Please Note:Import duties, taxes, and charges are not included in the item price or shipping cost. These charges are the buyer's responsibility. Please check with your country's customs office to determine what these additional costs will be prior to bidding or buying. Many of our items are shipped using Ebay's Global Shipping program.
