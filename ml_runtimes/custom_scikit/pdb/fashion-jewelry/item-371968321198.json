Additional Features: This watch comes packaged in a Stuhrling Original watch box with an instruction manual, warranty information and polishing cloth. About Krysterna: Developed for the high-end eyeglass industry, Krysterna is a synthetic transparent material which is distinguished by its extreme durability. Stuhrling Original was involved in Krysterna's early development and was one of the first watch makers to incorporate this physically powerful material into a timepiece as a crystal. Because Krysterna has more strength spread over a spread surface than sapphire, it is considered more shatter-resistant than a sapphire crystal. Make It Yours and Enjoy for Years and Years !!!
