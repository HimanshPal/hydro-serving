With more than 5000 years history in mankind\u2019s history, pearl is the \u201cqueen of gems\u201d. From ancient emperors, to the royalty and celebrities of today, pearls have been adored as a sign of wealth and exquisite taste. - Nowadays, fresh water pearls are becoming more and more fashionable for people around the world. 95% of fresh water pearls are grown in China. The annual output is around 1500 tons. - With great quality and affordable price, freshwater pearl has become an popular alternative to the Japanese Akoya pearl and south sea pearl. Fresh water pearl has created a renewed fashion in pearls world as an affordable alternative to the costly saltwater pearls, like Akoya, South Sea Pearl and Tahitian Pearl. \u3000 Caring for Your Pearls Even cultured pearls with thicker coatings are more fragile than most other gemstones, so you must handle them carefully to keep them in the best condition. Your pearls will stay cleaner if you put them on after you've applied your makeup and perfume. \u3000 Be sure to take off your pearl rings before you apply hand and body creams. \u3000 Wipe your pearls with a soft, lint-free cloth as soon as you take them off. The cloth can be dampened with water or it can be dry. If damp, allow the pearls to air dry before putting them away. \u3000 Dirty pearls can be cleaned with a mild soap and water solution. \u3000 Never clean your pearls with solutions that contain ammonia or harsh detergents. \u3000 Don't put pearl jewelry in an ultrasonic cleaner. \u3000 Don't use abrasive cleaners or rub pearls with abrasive cloth. Both can wear away the nacre coating, leaving you with a plain looking bead. Storing Pearls Don't store your pearls with other jewelry, because they can be scratched easily when metal or gemstones rub against them. Find a special slot in your jewelry box for the pearls, or keep them in a soft bag made from chamois or another non-abrasive material. Your fine pearl necklaces should be restrung periodically so that you're sure the silk or nylon cord holding them is in good shape. Restring Your Pearls And Knot For Safety To prevent strand breakage, it's a good idea to have your pearls restrung periodically -- perhaps once a year or so if you wear them often. Knotting the strand between each pearl will prevent all of the pearls from falling off the strand in the event the strand breaks. Also, knotting prevents the pearls from rubbing against one another and causing damage. A little bit of care can go a long way toward ensuring that your pearls remain safe and bright for years to come! Our pearl necklaces are all knotted.
