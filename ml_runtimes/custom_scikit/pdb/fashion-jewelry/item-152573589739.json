HOW TO CARE FOR YOUR NEW JEWELRY Here are some tips I have learned thru out the years: \u00b7 Never force open lever backs of new earrings. Gently and slowly open back lever of earrings. You can do this a few times to loosen them up. \u00b7 Always keep your jewelry either in boxes or plastic small \u201ccraft\u201d bags. This keeps jewelry from bumping into each other thereby increasing possibility of losing stones. \u00b7 NEVER put perfume on over your jewelry. Love your jewelry! PAYMENT POLICY: You may pay via Paypal. All major credit cards accepted. Unless making multiple purchases, payment will be due within 3 days of auction close. SHIPPING TERMSDOMESTIC SHIPPING: IF YOU PURCHASE MULTIPLE JEWELRY PIECES FROM ME WITH A VALUE OF $100.00 +, , THEY CAN ALL BE SHIPPED IN U.S.P.S.
