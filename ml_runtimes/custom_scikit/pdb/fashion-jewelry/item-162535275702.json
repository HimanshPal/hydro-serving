  "Description": "This auction is for an AMAZING, gold-tone and crystal headdress by Kirks Folly. This retired, RARE, VERY hard to find Fairy Veil is a showstopping must-have for any fairy, flapper, belly dancer, or anyone who just loves to sparkle!! Let your head literally drip with chains of aurora borealis crystals, beads, and gold spangles - or your neck, since it can also be worn as a necklace! This unique piece is EXTREMELY SPARKLY in any light, and the slightest bit of movement will set the whole thing glistening. Photos really don't capture the full dynamic beauty of this piece. The headpiece has a hook closure, so it is adjustable from as small as you want up to 24.5\" (so it can also be worn as a belt or corset chain, if you are tiny!) One end is signed with a large Kirks Folly hangtag. Metal is extremely shiny with no wear or tarnish. The longest chain drape is 4.75\" long; shortest is 1\" long. This unique piece of body jewelry will get you noticed!!! This piece is in perfect condition, no missing crystals, wearable and beautiful. Nice gift. Shipping price includes insurance. Please take a look at my other auctions - if you win multiple items, I will always combine shipping (but please wait for me to invoice you before paying.) The photo above is the actual item you will receive. All items come from a smoke-free home. Please contact me with any questions BEFORE BIDDING. Happy bidding! International Buyers \u2013 Please Note: Import duties, taxes, and charges are not included in the item price or shipping cost.These charges are the buyer's responsibility. Please check with your country's customs office to determine what these additional costs will be prior to bidding or buying.",
