  "Title": "Sterling Silver/925 Inspired Cut Cubic Round CZ Engagement Ring 5 L23",
  "Location": "Wingo, Kentucky",
  "Description": "STERLING I have for offer a sterling silver/925 Inspired Cut Cubic Round CZ Engagement ring size 5. I assume the stones are manmade as I have no means to test. The stone measures 7mm diameter. It is fully marked, tested and verified weighing in at 3.2 grams. There are no problems save for ordinary and normal use marks. Comes from a clean, smoke-free home. Terms/DSR\u2019s: Item as Described: If I miss something, you will be refunded in full including the return shipping. If it is my fault, I will pay. Communication: I ship every morning and at that time you will receive a message from me with your delivery confirmation number. The post office rarely scans the packages in so do not expect to see anything at their website until your item arrives at your door. If you have any questions or concerns during the process, please do not hesitate to ask. Shipping time: I go to the Post Office everyday at 10:30AM. If payment is made before then it will go out in that shipment. If payment is made after that, it will go out the next day. I cannot guarantee how long the carrier will take to get your item to you. If I could make them go any faster, I would. Shipping & Handling Charges: The shipping charges are what it costs to ship your item plus the costs of the materials. I have never, nor will I ever profit from these charges. On the rare cases that I have grossly overestimated the charges, I always refund the difference. I always eat the money the times I under charge. Feedback: Everyone has their own preferences for feedback. If you want me to leave it first, just let me know. Otherwise, my system automatically leaves feedback when you leave it. Basically: My wife and I have made a life decision to sell the things that will allow us to better our future. We both have day jobs so if you ask any questions during that time, we may not be able to answer until that evening. If you are not happy, then we are not happy. Let us know and we will make it right. Payment is due in seven days. For refunds, items must be in identical condition when returned within seven days of receipt. 0-000 Powered by eBay Turbo Lister The free listing tool.
