Express your individuality and versatility with this beautiful jewelry! Brand new! Absolutely guaranteed authentic. My Kameleon Jewelry was purchased from a jeweler who was going out of business and needed to liquidate inventory. All of my designer jewelry came from jewelers who were authorized retailers of the product line. Be sure to check out my other items! I have a huge variety of brand name charms at below retail prices. Shipping is always free within the USA. I would love to combine shipping for international bidders. There is only one shipping charge, no matter how many beads are purchased! Express mail options are available for additional charge for both USA and international bidders. Please note: We are not responsible for customs fees or duties charged in your own country. Please check with your customs office regarding fees before bidding. Do not confuse customs fees with shipping charges. Federal law prohibits us marking items as a \"gift\". Returns accepted within 7 days of receipt (please contact me if planning to return). Returned items must be in the same condition received. International bidders: There is only ONE shipping charge no matter how many beads/bracelets you buy from me (payment must be made for all beads at the same time - feel free to collect for up to 7 days and I will send a combined invoice for all items). Check out my store and purchase more than one! Please note: My goal is always 100% complete customer satisfaction. If for any reason you feel your item arrives \"not as described\", please contact me before leaving feedback. I am a trading assistant. I can sell items for you! |MLM|",
