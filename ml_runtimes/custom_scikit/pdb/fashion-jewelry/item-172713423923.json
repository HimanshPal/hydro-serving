  "Description": "Known for her celebration of the exuberant, the embellished and the over the top, Betsey has been rocking the fashion industry with her unique and original designs since the 1960\u2019s. Her commitment to remain true to her one-of-a-kind vision has afforded Betsey continued success in an industry known for its fickleness. Her ability to change with the times while keeping her designs pure has not gone unnoticed. PLEASE NOTE: THE PICTURES WERE SHOT WITH THE BOTTOM OF THE GOLDFISH BACKWARDS, WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IS THE BACK. THE FRONT IS FULL OF CLEAR CRYSTALS. I WILL REPLACE ASAP. THANKS THIS IS A GORGEOUS SET STARTING WITH THE NECKLACE. THE NECKLACE IS 28\" IN LENGTH WITH A 3 1/2\" EXTENSION. THE PENDANT IS A BEAUTIFUL GOLD FISH WITH HIS BODY BEING AN OPAL TYPE AND THAT IS COVERED WITH A LACY GOLD TONE FRONT AND BACK WITH GOLDEN FINS. HIS FLOWING TAIL IS MOVABLE AND IS COVERED IN CLEAR CRYSTALS HIS EYES ARE RAISED RED CRYSTALS. HE IS A LOVELY FISH THAT IS 3\" LONG BY 1 1/2\". THE BETSEY JOHNSON HEART AND TAG IS ATTACHED. ALL OF THESE CRYSTALS ARE SO MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL IN PERSON, THE CAMERA JUST DOES NOT PICK UP THE BEAUTY OF THEM. THE EARRINGS ARE JUST SO UNIQUE AND MATCH THE NECKLACE PERFECTLY. THEY HAVE A BEAUTIFUL RED BODY WITH MOVABLE TAIL COVERED IN CRYSTALS. THE EYES STAND UP AND ARE BLACK CRYSTALS. THEY ARE ABOUT 1 3/4\" LONG BY 1/2\" WIDE AND THEY ARE MOUNTED ON A BETSEY JOHNSON CARD. THEY ARE MOUNTED ON WIRES AND HAVE A RUBBER STOP CLOSURE FOR COMFORT AND SECURITY.
