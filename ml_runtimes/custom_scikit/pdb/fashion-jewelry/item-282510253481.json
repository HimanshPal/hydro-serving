All my charms are purchased from very well reputable pre owned Pandora authorized dealer who provides me purchase receipts to proof its authenticity for every charm I list on ebay . I also encourage all buyers , if in concern please take your charm to your local Pandora store for verification before coming to a conclusion and leaving harmful feedbacks which can ruin one's reputation which took a lot of effort and caring to built. Feedback : Please ! Please ! contact me and at least give me a chance to resolve any issue prior to leaving any negative or neutral feedback. I want everyone to have a great experience and am and will continue to do my best to resolve any addressed concern or issue . I am here to work with you. Payment grace period : My usual grace period is 5 days from the day the auction ends but if anyone needs more days just send me an email. I usually send a courtesy email on the 5th day please don't be unresponsive just let me know if any problem that way change of heart bidders can request for a cancel transaction other than getting an unpaid item case which you can avoid just by communicating with me . I do offer a money refund policy that should tell you I am flexible. It is really hurtful when people pays after unpaid item case just to give a negative feedback. Everything can be resolved gracefully. Thank you so much for all your support and taking the time to read this notes , I hope to provide you all with an impeccable and fun ebay experience !! just a little help needed :) Please feel free to contact me if you have any question H A P P Y B I D D I N G !!!!!!!!",
