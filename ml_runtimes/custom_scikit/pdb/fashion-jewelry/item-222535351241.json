I highly recommend looking up blog reviews/swatches prior to purchasing any color cosmetics.

No international buyers. No returns. Shipping: I ship within one day after payment is received (please be aware of USPS holidays/no mail on Sunday). Payment required within 5 days of winning bid/purchase. I will then open an unpaid item case. I always offer free shipping on Buy it Now and use quality shipping materials (keep in mind, postage and quality packaging really add up, so my buy it now prices reflect the cost of shipping and packaging).
