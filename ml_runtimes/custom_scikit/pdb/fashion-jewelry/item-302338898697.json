Shipping/HandlingAll items are shipped with careful packaging to prevent any damage to item. I try to keep costs down as much as possible, however if an item is fragile, more packaging and materials makes the package heavier and shipping is not cheap. ReturnsReturns are accepted with buyer paying shipping/handling charges for any items returned. All items must be in the same condition they were when you received the item. Items must be returned within 14 days once you have received the item. FeedbackFeedback will be left once we receive feedback. Often times, buyers don't want to take the time to leave feedback which benefits all parties involved. This includes the buyer, seller, and the public. Please always contact us before leaving any negative feedback and we will try to fix the problem first. There is no problem big or small that we cannot try to fix. More InformationPlease keep checking back with us as we will be adding a lot of new items within an online store. Until then, please check out my other items or follow us.
