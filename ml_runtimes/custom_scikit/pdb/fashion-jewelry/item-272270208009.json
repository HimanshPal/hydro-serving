    "Description": "WHAT IS GLEEM\u2019S RETURN POLICY?\nTo return an item, contact Gleem\u2019s Customer Care team by sending a message through eBay or call us at 888-885-8701 (M-F, 9am-6pm ET) within 14 days the date FedEx receives the item from GLEEM & CO for outbound shipping. Please be sure to notify us within 14 days of this date. Returned items must be in unworn, unchanged condition (both the piece and its component gemstones) with all security tags intact.\n\nOnce we have opened a Return ticket, we will invoice the Buyer via PayPal for the cost of shipping their return item with an insured prepaid shipping label for FedEx. For FedEx pickup service, the customer must coordinate details directly with FedEx. The supplemental tracking and insurance provided by BRINKS will be applied automatically. Buyer may select to return their item using an alternate shipping method, but the package must be in its original packaging and insured for the full retail value with an adult signature required.\n\nPlease note that BRINKS requires all items be double boxed. The package must be postmarked within 30 days of the original delivery date and must be returned with the original Gleem security tag still in tact and un-tampered with. Upon receipt of your package, Gleem will conduct a reappraisal to ensure unchanged condition of the piece and component gemstones. Please allow up to 2 weeks for final processing of the refund, which would be issued in the same manner as original payment was collected, either by major credit card or PayPal.\n\nHOW WILL I BE REFUNDED?\nWe will process refunds using the same payment method used for the original purchase. If you used a credit card or PayPal, we will refund the full purchase price. If you prefer, we can also provide GLEEM & CO credit, and would be happy to provide a $50 bonus for choosing this method.  Limits apply.\n\nI HAVE ITEMS TO RETURN FROM MULTIPLE ORDERS. CAN I SEND THEM TOGETHER IN THE SAME BOX?\nYes of course. Just make sure you notify us of each item so that the insurance may be set appropriately and mark each item you're including on the return slip.",
