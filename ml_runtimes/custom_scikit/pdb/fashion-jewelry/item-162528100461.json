  "Description": "Up for auction is a Silpada pendant that also has a pin back, along with matching earrings. These are very rare. The pendant is sterling open cutwork design and the earrings coordinate. They are oxidized sterling and feature faceted citrine stones. The pendant has a large bale and will accommodate almost any chain or necklace. These are featured in the 2006-07 catalog where it was listed on page 46 as item S1221 and W1221. This is listed as used, but is in perfect condition and shows no sign of wear. I have too much Silpada and need to thin the jewelry box. It will ship in a Silpada box if requested. It will not be the original box, as I did not mark the boxes. I am cleaning my closets and will be listing a lot more items. Please check my other listings over the next few weeks for great women's and children's clothes, toys and jewelry. Please email with questions, I won't be able to accept returns. I will combine shipping to the best of my ability. I only charge actual shipping charges. Shipping is expensive. Please consider this when bidding and don't leave negative feedback for something beyond my control.",
