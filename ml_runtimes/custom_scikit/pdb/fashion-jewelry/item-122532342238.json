Keep protected in a jewelry box; \u2022 avoid exposing your jewelry to solvents, perfumes, hair sprays or other chemicals. Make sure that these are applied and fully absorbed before putting on your jewelry; \u2022 oils in skin and sulphur in some knitwear can tarnish jewelry, but this can be kept minimal by caring for it; \u2022 do not wear your jewelry whilst in bed, showering, gardening, doing housework, swimming or at the gym; \u2022 keep away from hard surfaces.
