Silver-plated jewellery comes originally from the 19th century and was created to provide what would be expensive items to the masses. It is again in high demand since last few years because of consistent increase in raw silver prices world-over. Our jewelry is made with high quality silver plating procedures but all silver-plated jewelry tarnishes at some point, as the chemicals from daily wear and the exposed layer of silver may react with air to change the color of the item. Therefore it is necessary to protect and increase life of the items using the tips below: \u2022 Be sure to keep silver plated items away from water, soaps, makeup and perfumes. Take off your jewelry before washing or bathing. \u2022 Clean it gently with soft cloth or an appropriate jewelry cleaner. This could help to eliminate any dirt or dust which will wear away the layer on the jewelry surface. \u2022 When not wearing your jewelry, store it in a dry place or wrap with soft material.

We don't restrict buyers for a short time-frame for bidding and payments. You can easily bid and buy till you wish. Generally, we hope that buyer should make one combined Payment within 20 days of first bidding date. 30 days is the maximum because after that eBay doesn't allow buyers to checkout. Q.

If the item says \u201cNew\u201d under item condition then that means it is a brand new item exactly like the one you would find in your local retail store, the only difference is that our price is much lower as we are manufacturers ourselves. Q. Is a signature required upon delivery? A. In most cases a signature in person is required for delivery. If you will not be home during the day to sign for the package, please have the item shipped to your work address instead. inkFrog Analytics",
