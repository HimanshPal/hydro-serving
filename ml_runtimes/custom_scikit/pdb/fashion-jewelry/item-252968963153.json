This fabulous choker features 11 fabulous graduating oval disks with glass flowers that have a jade look. Each flower has a peridot Swarovski crystal center. The flowers are surrounded by awesome glass mirror pieces that appear to change from shades of green to yellow. The base choker is a chunky hammered goldtone. Coordinating earrings are pierced style. The choker is a heavy, substantial piece, weighing 6.2 ounces. However, the earrings are not heavy, so no need to worry about stretching your pierced ear hole. OMG....I love it! This piece retails for $640! Never heard of Iris G? You won't find her on the web or in chain department stores. Iris G sells her designs to an exclusive clientele that includes very high-end boutiques and celebrities. Each design is one-of-a-kind...no exact duplicates EVER, no assembly lines in China or elsewhere. Each piece is meticulously hand-crafted by the designer herself. Iris G uses genuine Swarovski crystals, quality plastics, and natural gemstones. She often incorporates vintage components into her designs. Iris G enjoys the art, not the fame or name recognition. Iris G does not even bother to sign her jewelry pieces. She occasionally tags a specialty item. Her runway pieces are in huge demand at prices well over my asking prices, and she stays back-ordered for many months at a time. Are you tired of designers originating a handful of designs and having thousands of copies of each mass produced in China? Are you instead ready for a designer who originates thousands of designs and produces each only ONCE, meticulously by their own hand? If you prefer fabulous one-of-a-kind BLING jewelry and accessory items, you will love Iris G!
