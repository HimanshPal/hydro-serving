  "Description": "Beautiful set by Honora Pearl. The set is well made, substantial weight on the pearls. They are cultured freshwater pearls. The necklace measures 20\" in length. The clasp is called a \"rocker\" clasp. It is marked 924 H on the side, and is a base metal on the bottom. You push in one side of the clasp on the bottom and the pin slides out. Very easy to do. The set has three matching stretch bracelets that measure 7\" in length. As mentioned on QVC: Expect first-rate quality. As one of the largest distributors of Chinese cultured freshwater pearls in the U.S., Honora offers extraordinary value. Please email me with any questions.
