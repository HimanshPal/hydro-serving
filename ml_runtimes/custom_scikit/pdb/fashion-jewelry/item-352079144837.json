  "Description": "STERLING SILVER & 14K GOLD FILLED ANCHOR STYLE DOUBLE CHAIN 23 3/4\" In this design I\u2019ve combined two colors: golden and silver, and it make possible to reach the visibility of volume and allows breaking the monotony of one color. Measures: Length: 23 3/4\" (600 mm) Width: 3.5 mm Weight: 20.8 gram (0.735 oz) Material: 925 Sterling Silver & 14K Gold Filled Silver & gold filled finish: polish Clasp type: heavy lobster claw clasp Hallmark: 925 Condition: new Place of origin: Israel Manufacturer: Green Diamond SJD Gold-filled metal is made by bonding a layer of gold, usually 100 times thicker than plating, to a base metal. To be considered gold filled the amount of gold is at least 1/20th the total weight. The amount of real gold used is why GF items are always more expensive than their gold plated counterparts. This results in a metal that is very durable and does not flake off or rub off. Like solid gold, gold-filled metal will eventually tarnish. To clean it you need to use soft soapy water, which restores the shine to your jewelry or take your piece to jeweler for \u201csteam\u201d cleaning. Never use harsh chemicals or abrasives for cleaning. SHIPPING AND PAYMENT Please, read my terms of shipping and payment attentively before bidding. By bidding on my items you agree with my rules.
