  "Description": "\"CHUBBY\" CAT BROOCH. \u2028This is a lovely piece. It is one of Pavone's early pieces. Known as her \"Old Series\". These were made in the early 80s when she started to design and make her own range. They were more labour intensive than the later pieces, with much more hand painting. They were very limited in number and some are quite rare now. Some may be the only ones left, most are limited. They are good collectors items from the early years of this popular artist. They are all from my own collection. Good condition. Signed. Size 6cm x 5cm APPROXIMATELY. \u2028 All of my pieces are original. They come direct from Pavone's studio in France. I have known Marie Christine for many years and collected many lovely pieces over that time. Her work is unique. It is largely cut from old Galalith (not moulded). It is then dyed to get the great colours she is known for, hand made, hand painted, polished and glazed. This makes each piece it's own little work of art. In a world of laser cut mass production, it is rare to find someone committed to making everything by hand. \u2028 Thanks for looking... Don't forget to check my other items.",
