  "Description": "This Nose Ring is AWESOME, UNIQUE, AND DAZZLING!!! WE LOVE THESE!!! This ring is made with a multistage, unique technique, resulting in tiny divots which catch and reflect the light beautifully, mimicking a type of diamond cut effect. When in the light, this nose ring reflects the light on these countless small divots, giving the nose ring a look of almost being covered in some sort of \"diamond dust\" when in bright light or in the sun. Basically, this ring is great for someone who wants a little bit of sparkle on their nose or ear...and who doesn't? :) 1 (one) Nose Ring /Cuff -TINY Small Diamond style cut 14k White Gold Hoop Earrings Pierced or Non Pierced, Cartilage, or helix.

Our items are American made and shipped from America. When you buy from us, you are receiving jewelry handcrafted by a professionally trained artist living in the Atlanta area, and NOT mass produced foreign goods. Feel free to message us with any questions and make sure you check out our other listings for more great jewelry!\u00a0We ship most items in 1-3 days. Some solid gold items take longer to ship if they are not in stock.Some general notes about purchasing: This is obvious to most people and applies to any place you shop online, but we like to include this info, just in case :) Please allow 24-72 business day hours for a response when sending an email via eBay's messaging service. We try our best to answer emails within a few hours, but occasionally this is not possible. When selecting jewelry, please keep in mind any metal allergies the intended wearer may have, as we are not responsible and cannot control any allergic reactions the wearer may have as a result of metal allergies.\u00a0Please also make sure you are selecting the correct size item that will fit you (hoops are quoted in approximate INSIDE diameter - these are measured carefully while being made, but can vary by a few mm, but it's not likely. If you have very specific needs for size, please let us know and we'll be sure to make your item as close to the measurement you desire as possible. Every item is a little different due to the items being made by hand, but the photo in the listing is a very very good indication of what the item will look like. If you have any questions about sizing, please make sure to inquire about this via eBay's messaging system to the seller. Most hoops need to be bent to put them on, this means that the item can lose it's shape if not bent the correct way when put on (it opens in a spiral direction - instructions are included), so it is important to follow the instructions on how to put the hoop in correctly and you'll be able to enjoy your item for a long time.\u00a0Please also note that we are not responsible for any delays that may occur once the package is dropped in the mail. Occasionally, shipping delays may occur, and we have no control over this. Estimated handling times are stated in the listing, and also under the shipping tab. This is quoted in business days (Monday-Friday), though we often ship sooner than the quoted handling time. If it is very important for you to get your item sooner, please inquire before purchasing, and we will let you know if we are able to accommodate your request. While most items have the same handling time as the one listed, some items may have a longer handling time than what is listed due to the need to special order materials (this is rare, though). Please inquire about handling time before purchasing if receiving your item by a certain day is very important to you.Please keep in mind that monitors very in size and color, so item color or size may vary slightly from picture. Our items are made by hand, so we strive to make our listing accurate and realistic. These are just standard things that apply to most listings on Ebay, but we like to mention them.\u00a0We've been making jewelry for a long time, and love what we do :) Let us know if there is any way we can help you or a custom item we can make for you :)Please note with body jewelry that the thicker the gauge and smaller the inside diameter of our hoops (including our hoops, captive rings, etc, anything with a ring/hoop), the higher the chance that you may need help to insert the body ring by going to a professional piercer to have it installed. Also, most of our items listed are hand made and because of that, each item may differ a little from the photo in the listing. This is what makes every item unique. The listing photo is representative of what you will receive, but because of the handmade nature of most of our listings, your item may vary slightly from the listing photo. Every effort is made to accurately represent the item you are purchasing.",
