  "Description": "I ship to USA only and it must be your registered Ebay address. This bead is an authentic, limited edition, Trollbeads called faceted aurora ( some people call it aurora bubbles) It is the faceted bead from the limited edition stories of you set. This bead is new and unworn and was obtained from a Trollbeads dealer who discontinued the line. This auction is for the ONE bead only, no bracelet or clasp. I have included pictures of all sides of the exact bead you are buying so you know exactly what you get. Please make sure to look at all the pictures.It is really hard to capture the beauty of this bead. The look changes with the light and the angle. All the pictures were taken in natural daylight on an overcast day without flash. I also included a picture with some other beads so you can see how stunning this looks on a bracelet. THE OTHER BEADS AND BRACELET ARE NOT INCLUDED. THEY ARE FOR DISPLAY ONLY. THIS LISTING IS ONLY FOR THE FACETED AURORA BEAD ONLY. (4TH ONE IN ON THE BOTTOM) All sales are final, no returns accepted. I am prompt with shipping & pack very well. I use the Postal Service. Much effort is put into giving you an HONEST, accurate description and photos so you know exactly what you are getting. There for, all sales are final. NO RETURNS. TERMS: PLEASE READ Will ship to U.S.A. only. (to your registered Ebay shipping address) No PO boxes. Payment should be made within 2 days of auction end. NO RETURNS Feel free to ask any questions BEFORE you bid Thank you for your consideration and have a great day!",
