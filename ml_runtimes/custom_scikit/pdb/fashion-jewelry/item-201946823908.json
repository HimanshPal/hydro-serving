LeONDARAKIS JEWELERS HISTORY ALEXANDRIA OF EGYPT 1920 Alkiviadis Leondarakis, Alexander's father, sets up his first jewelry workshop. The artifacts crafted by his skilful hands are European style jewels that will adorn the women of cosmopolitan Alexandria during the war. He used platinum, gold, diamonds, sapphires and rubies. Alexandria of Egypt 1940-1950 Alexander, after graduating from high school, decides to learn the secrets of his father's skill as an apprentice. Post war social changes will oblige Leondarakis' family to repatriate. So Alexander will bring this tradition back to Athens (1958) with great reverence. Athens 1960-1970 Alexander enriches his knowledge on his father's craft with postgraduate studies at the Umanitaria college in Milan. Among his teachers are renowned artists like the Pomodoro brothers.

Marialena \u2013 with studies in fine arts, graphic arts, architectural design, photography and gemmology - and Irini \u2013 with studies in archaeology and museology \u2013 are now keeping on their grandfather\u2019s tradition.
