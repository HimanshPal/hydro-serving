  "Description": "Les NereidesCOUPLE OF BIRDS ON A BRANCH OF CHERRY TREE AND CHARMS NECKLACE Here, delicately and in detail, Les N\u00e9r\u00e9ides tells a beautiful story that finds its rhythm in the changing seasons. It is inspired by two migrating birds, known as much for the beauty of their plumage as for their melodious song. The goldfinch resting on the branches of the flowering cherry tree announces the coming of spring, whilst the golden oriole surrounded by bright red cherries sings a song of summer. A bucolic collection with an elaborate palette of harmonious colours bringing together two of Les N\u00e9r\u00e9ides' most successful themes.Materials : Hand-enameled brass, rhinestones, faceted glass, 14K gold plated brass chain 0 0 1 93 573 Glyn Peter Machin 4 1 665 14.0 Normal 0 21 false false false EN-US ZH-CN X-NONE Dimension :42cm + 5cm extension PLEASE NOTE : - Necklace is in brand new condition without tag, with branded pouch.
