  "Description": "\"CLAWS\" CAT BROOCH... \u2028This is a lovely piece from Pavone's early years. Known as the\"Old Series\". It is part of a collection made in the early 80s, when she first started to design and make her own range. They were very labour intensive, with much more hand painting than the later versions. They were very limited in number. Some are quite rare now and some are the only ones left. They are nice collectors items from the early years of this popular artist. They are all from my own collection. Good condition. Signed. This model came in 2 sizes, this is the smaller version. Size 5.5cm x 4cm APPROXIMATELY. \u2028 All of my pieces are original. They came direct from Pavone's studio in France. I have known Marie Christine for many years and collected many lovely pieces over that time. Her work is unique. It is largely cut from old Galalith (not moulded). It is then dyed to get the great colours she is known for, hand made, hand painted, polished and glazed. This makes each piece it's own little work of art. In a world of laser cut mass production, it is rare to find someone committed to making everything by hand. \u2028 Thanks for looking... Don't forget to check my other items.",
