  "ReturnPolicy": {
    "Description": "You may return most new, unopened items within 30 days of delivery for a full refund (less any shipping costs and/or custom/duty/taxes fees). We will only pay the return shipping cost if the return is a result of our error (you received an incorrect or defective item, etc.). All other returns are subject to a 25% restocking fee and return shipping is not covered. We do not accept returns for any items that have been opened, used or damaged or that have had the security tag removed. All returns must include all tags and original package inserts as well as packaging. We do not accept returns on any of the cosmetic items we sell (including but not limited to beauty accessories, ie; brushes) or on any of our designer handbags, accessories or clothing. In the event your package arrives damaged by the post office, please contact us immediately (with a photo, if possible, of the damaged package and item). You should expect to receive your refund within four weeks from the day you shipped, however, in many cases you will receive a refund more quickly. This time period includes the transit time for us to receive your return from the shipper (7 to 28 business days), and the time it takes us to process your return once we receive it (1 to 3 business days).",
