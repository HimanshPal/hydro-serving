  "Description": "10mm LIGHT BLUE OPAL HORSESHOE Symbol Charm Pendant with Real 14kt Gold Filled Fine Chain Necklace - For Good Luck! GF TVS 06 Size of the Pendant: about 10mm ( about 3/8\" ) Stone: Created LIGHT BLUE OPAL ( The color changes in different positions )Shape of the Stone: Horseshoe Clasp: 14kt Gold Filled Spring Ring Clasp Chain type: 14kt 1/20 Gold Filled Fine Chain, about 0.6mm thick Length of the Chain: about 42cm ( about 16.5\" ) We can make the chain shorter or longer ( up to 50cm 20\" ) with no extra charge. ( Please put a note to your payment )All the weights, sizes, lengths, thicknesses are approximate.Due to the conversion from centimeters to inches, the chains are a little bit shorter than advertised length in inches. Gold Filled: Gold filled is an actual layer of gold-pressure bonded to another metal. Gold filled is not to be confused with gold plating as filled literally has 100% more gold than gold plating. Gold filled is much more valuable and tarnish resistant. It does not flake off, rub off or turn colors. As a matter of fact, anyone who can wear gold can wear gold filled without worries of any allergic reaction to the jewelry. Gold filled jewelry is an economical alternative to solid gold!",
