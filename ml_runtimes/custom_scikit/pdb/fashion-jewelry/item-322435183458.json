  "Description": "I have had held back from using as show piece only. This little trio is a hard to find set. They have not been ever owned by anyone but me, as a rep. for my show table. They will come in a nice Silpada box and cloth gift bag inside. The one has a coral stone to intertwine nicely with the other 2. Wear together or separate. Silpada Designs jewelry is all hand made by artisans from all over the world. Each piece is worked for many hours and sometimes days to create these excellent hand- made pieces. Each piece is nickel free and .925, the highest grade of sterling made. You aren\u2019t just wearing a piece of jewelry; Silpada is art and collected by women all over the nation. There is an enormous difference between silver-plated and sterling silver jewelry. Silver plate is the process of bonding an extremely thin layer (measured in microns) of silver to a base metal; most commonly used are copper, brass, white metal, or nickel. This layer of silver is very thin and does not hold up. It will chip, permanently discolor, break, bend, etc. It will NOT shine up with a polishing cloth. Sterling silver is 92.5% pure silver, which is why it is so much more expensive than plated items. Any jewelry that is true .925 sterling silver should be marked as with Silpada. A simple polishing of your Silpada will keep it shiny and pretty. All my Sterling jewelry will come to you with an anti-tarnish strip and in a Silpada gift box, clean, shiny and delivered with passion and love that I have for Silpada.",
