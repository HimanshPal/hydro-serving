  "Description": "Kenneth Jay Lane is an established hollywood and society jewelry designer since the 1930's...he always seems to anticipate the trends of fashion jewelry and his items are very collectible and actually increase in value in time and as they are no longer available. This is a pin from my personal collection, a true collectible! Made up of enamelling simulating a shiny red version of a piece of coral, Kenneth Jay Lane went several steps further in this original design, and added an immense \"emerald\"faceted stone in the center, and a scattering of triangular clear crystals all over it! Put it on a jacket, a sweater, any sort of top, and you look sensational! A REAL WOW effect! The pin functions perfectly fine, it measures 3 inches square, the main green store measures 18 mm x 14 mm. Put it on, and you don't need anything else! That's the message from Kenneth Jay Lane! His trademark \"Kenneth Lane\" is on the underside of the pin. I tried to photograph it.This would make the fashion scene in any location, any social event! Most people who own one of these pins don't sell it, so finding one is truly rare! These pins go for more than twice what I have priced itThis one is priced to sell......don't let this bargain pass you by! It FEELS GOOD, it LOOKS GOOD, and you're going to LOVE it! It's attractive! It's FUN to wear! There's nothing skimpy about this.....it makes a statement! People WILL comment on it!! This is an investment in a good designer piece of jewelry that can be worn over and over. Don't let this get away from you! I believe in Honesty is the Best Policy. If you are not truly happy with the purchase, I stand by my return policy. This comes from a nonsmoker's environment. Feel free to email me with any questions. If you get several items from my listings, I can reduce the shipping costs if I can pack them in the same box. Selling only to USA or to countries in the Global Shipping Progam. Please pay within 3 days of end of auction. I will send your item by priority mail the next workday after receiving payment!! Thank you!",
