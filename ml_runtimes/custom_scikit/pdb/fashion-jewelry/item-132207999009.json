Most items are cleaned and polished to a degree to look almost brand new. Deep cleaning is left up to the buyer on some items. Vintage Sterling Silver Jewelry may have the patina left in place. Vermeil: (Pronounced: Vermay) is sterling silver that has been gold-plated. Most of our vermeil is plated with 22K-24K gold. This is a good combination for those with allergy to normal, plated jewelry items. The difference between vermeil, and gold-filled, is in the thickness of the gold and the base metal used. In vermeil, the base is sterling silver. To be considered vermeil, the gold must be at least 10 carat (42%) and be at least 2.5 micrometres thick. Gold-plated: A base metal such as steel or brass is dipped into a bath of electroplating solution, with a lump of solid gold. When an electric current is applied, a thin layer of gold is deposited on the metal. Since the plating is quite thin, the plate (and hence the color) on findings can wear off. Sterling Silver: is a mixture of pure silver and some other metal, usually copper. The resulting alloy gives the silver strength. The standard is at least 92.5% silver. Hence the .925 stamp you see on some sterling silver items. Gold-filled: also called rolled-gold. These jewelry items are not actually filled with gold. They are made of a base metal (usually brass or copper) covered by sheets of gold in a mechanical bonding process. Effectively a thick coat of gold: the gold content is 5% or 1/20 of the total weight. Use gold-filled items for your top-of-the-line jewelry. Usually made with 14k gold, it is hard wearing. With reasonable care it will not peel or flake, and should last as long as solid 14k gold jewelry. It is safe for most people with sensitive skin. See my other listings for more great items!

With it comes the accumulated wisdom of the earth and its natural kingdom. You can often see little insects trapped in the amber while it started as a tree resin; this gives the amber stone quite powerful magical properties. The most popular amber stones come in warm colors - a variety of yellow, orange and sunny brown tones, this is why the amber was considered to be the stone of the sun. However, did you know that there are also amber stones that are found in blue, red and green colors?

Warm, healing, wise, protective, cheerful - these are just some of the properties attributed to the old and beautiful amber stone. The main supply of high quality amber comes from the Baltic countries in Northern Europe (there is a famous amber museum in Palanga, Lithuania, that I missed when I was there). Dominican Republic is also a good source of amber gemstone, especially the rare and highly prized blue amber. Amber is also found in Britain, Poland, Russia, Italy and Germany. As with any popular gemstone that has a long history of use in various cultures, amber has accumulated its share of mystical properties.

Tanzanite - Is a member of the zoisite family and is also known as blue zoisite. It was first discovered in Tanzania, Africa (1967). This stone activates several chakras from the heart to the crown and is used to link the mind with the heart. Tanzanite is an important communication stone, giving one the ability to speak the truth. Promotes compassion, raises consciousness in meditation, calms an overactive mind and brings on a peaceful understanding of one's own heart. Tanzanite is called a \"stone of magic\" that helps with spiritual awareness and psychic insight. It is also sometimes called the \"workaholic's stone\". This is because it helps you slow down and take it easy. This in turn, brings success in more areas of life. It relieves stress and depression, and enhances composure, poise, and harmony. Tanzanite is also said to transmute negativity. Physically it is said in healing folklore and crystal healing to be beneficial for stress related illnesses and high blood pressure in particular. Tanzanite is related primarily to the throat and third eye chakras. Tanzanite is an extraordinary gemstone. It occurs in only one place worldwide. Its blue, surrounded by a fine hint of purple, is a wonderful colour. It is named after the East African state of Tanzania, the only place in the world where it has been found. Tanzanite is a blue variety of the gemstone zoisite. It consists of calcium aluminium silicate and is not particularly hard, having a value of 6.5 to 7 on the Mohs scale. For that reason, it should always be worn carefully and never placed in an ultrasonic bath for cleaning or brought into contact with acids. The deep blue of the tanzanite is fantastic, and runs from ultramarine blue to light violet-blue. The most coveted colour is a blue surrounded by a delicate hint of purple, which has a particularly wonderful effect in sizes of over 10 carats. The well developed polychromaticity of the tanzanite is typical: depending on the angle from which you look at it, the stone may appear blue, purple or brownish-yellow. Having said that, most raw crystals are somewhat spoiled by a brownish-yellow component, though it can be made to disappear by the cutter if he heats the stone carefully in an oven to approximately 500\u00b0. It personifies immaculate, yet unconventional elegance. A person who wears it exudes confidence and individuality. The almost magical colour of a perfectly cut tanzanite is one that not only suits confident young women; it is also excellently suited to underlining the individuality of the more mature woman.
