It is made from a gold plated base metal and adorned with genuine Swarovski elements in sparkling clear and aurora borealis clear colors. This is a long retired item- does not comb with a SOHO bag or tag- they did not use the SOHO bags when they first opened and for the first few years. The comb has a graceful head hugging curve to it and can be worn in a French twist updo or on top of the head as a Tiara. This spectacular hair comb was originally listed for $118.00 plus tax. It measures 4 inches wide by 2 inches from decoration to bottom of teeth and is 5/8 inch in thickness (width across the crystals 4 inches by 5/8 inch).
