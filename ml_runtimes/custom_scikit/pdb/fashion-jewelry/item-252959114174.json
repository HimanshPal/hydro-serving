  "Description": "This is a very Nice 200 Pieces of jewelry that all have a Heart shape of some form on them. I have given many photos of all to show you how wonderful they are for Gifts to wear and enjoy or use for crafts.This is a used lot which does have a few that May be in need of fixing a clasp put on a chain or Replacing a Stone. I have counted all of the earring pairs as one and all of the pendent's with chains as one. There are a couple of single earrings also that may not have backs and would be wonderful for crafts. There are to many to list and I have given a few photos up close which shows them a coupled of times but there is only one of each. I am not a jeweler or a Gemologist so this lot has not been tested as I do not have that training and you are getting what I have collected and resell for added income.I will not accept a return or a Partial return on this lot but you will get exactly what is in the photos. Thank you for looking",
