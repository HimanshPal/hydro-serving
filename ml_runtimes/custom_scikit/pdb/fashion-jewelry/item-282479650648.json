  "ReturnPolicy": {
    "Description": "Jewelry that has been worn, resized, damaged, engraved, or otherwise altered after delivery will not be accepted for return, exchange or refund. All jewelry must be returned in new, unworn condition, and will undergo quality checks and inspection. If the jewelry has been worn or shows any sign of wear, it will be returned to you.  Jewelry boxes must be in new condition and must not be missing parts, dirty, or damaged.\n\nAll jewelry claimed to be defective may be exchanged for replacement only and will be inspected upon return.  Defect claims must be made by contacting us within 7 days of receipt of your purchase.  If  jewelry is determined to be damaged or otherwise altered after delivery and not manufacturer flaw, no refund will be issued and the jewelry will be sent back to you. \n\nBrown and black discoloration on .925 sterling silver jewelry is naturally occurring tarnish and is not a defect; it can be removed with silver cleaner. We hand clean all our sterling silver jewelry prior to packing of orders.  A green discoloration on skin is not an indication of \"fake\" or sub-quality silver.  Sterling silver is mixed with an alloy of copper, which can discolor skin depending on your body's chemistry. \n\nNo refunds on original order shipping charges. \n\nPlease contact us immediately if your shipment was damaged in transit. Damaged items must be returned within 5 days for shipping damage claims.\n\nRETURN INSTRUCTIONS\n\nPackage the item in similar packaging to what you received.
