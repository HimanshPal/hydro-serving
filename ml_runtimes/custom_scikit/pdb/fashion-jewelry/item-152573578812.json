PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT PICTURES ARE TAKEN MOSTLY CLOSE-UP AND THEREFORE MIGHT LOOK LARGER THAN IT REALLY IS HOW TO CARE FOR YOUR NEW JEWELRYHere are some tips I have learned thru out the years (this is good advice for all jewelry types):\u00b7 Never force open lever backs of new earrings. Gently and slowly open back lever of earrings. You can do this a few times to loosen them up.\u00b7 Always keep your jewelry either in boxes or plastic small \u201ccraft\u201d bags. This keeps jewelry from bumping into each other thereby increasing possibility of losing stones.\u00b7 NEVER put perfume on over your jewelry.\u00b7 Don\u2019t drop your jewelry! This jarrs the jewelry and could loosen a stone and eventually loosing one. \u00b7 LOVE AND ENJOY YOUR NEW JEWELRY!PLEASE SEE ALL OF THE PHOTOS, AS THEY ARE PART OF THE DESCRIPTION PAYMENT POLICY: You may pay via Paypal.
