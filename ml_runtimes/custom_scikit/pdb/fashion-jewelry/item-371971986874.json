  "Description": "This is a pre-owned Joan Rivers large brooch/pin. It is in excellent condition. Get it in time to wear the traditional poppy for Memorial weekend at the end of this month. Originally it sold on QVC as item # J-264160 but it is no longer available through them. Below is a description of the brooch/pin from their website. It weighs 2 oz. and will ship first class. \"If your jacket, coat, or scarf could use a pop of vibrant color, simply add this dimensional poppy brooch and hear the compliments roll in! Red-orange petals are encrusted with round, faceted crystals, while a large, round, black crystal is dripping with drama at the center. Surrounding the center black crystal are round, clear crystal accents for a stunning contrast. A green stem and leaves complete the absolutely splendid piece. Gunmetal finishDimensional design; red-orange petals encrusted with round, faceted crystals; large, round, black crystal at center surrounded by round, clear crystal accents; green stem and leavesStandard bar pin and catchMeasures approximately 2-3/4\"L x 3\"WMade in China\"All items are from a smoke-free environment. If I receive them and they have an odor it is pointed out in the description of the item. I combine all multiple winning bids to save on shipping. Just wait for a revised invoice. If you don\u2019t receive one in a timely manner email me, I may not have realized there were multiple wins. Please be considerate and pay immediately after the bidding is over. Waiting a week to 10 days, without letting me know, is not an A in my buyers\u2019 grade book. About Me: I have been an eBay member since the about 2003. At that time I started selling off some of my Dad\u2019s collectibles after he passed. Here and there I find some items to purchase for myself. Since retiring in 2014 from 33.5 yrs of teaching, I have been filling my time helping friends declutter their houses by selling items for them. They get to clear out their unwanted items and I get to save our earnings for monthly \u201cGirls\u2019 Night Out\u201d which is when we get together to have dinner at some local fine dining restaurant. It is a win-win. It is a hobby I enjoy without leaving the comfort of my home and we get a night out for good food and wine. Feedback: Please leave positive feedback and I will do the same for you. Since I began selling on eBay as a hobby back in 2003, I have worked very hard over the years to make sure all eBayers are happy with their purchases. My feedback speaks for itself. I do NOT consider myself an expert in any one category. However, I research and try to be as accurate as possible when posting a listing. Nobody is perfect. If you find errors in a listing or if you are an unhappy buyer, please let me know. If you absolutely LOVE an item, I really enjoy hearing about it and would welcome an email. I pride myself in being a great communicator.",
