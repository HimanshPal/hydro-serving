  "Description": "Up for auction is a Silpada pendant. The pendant is sterling and features hammered detail, with one side being heavier more oxodized finish, so you have your choice of which side to wear front facing. There is a dangle pearl that can be worn in front or hidden in back. The pendant has a large bale and will accommodate almost any chain or necklace. This pendant is featured in the 2009-10 catalog where it was listed on page 55 as S1955. This is listed as used, but is in perfect condition and shows no sign of wear. I have too much Silpada and need to thin the jewelry box. It will ship in a Silpada box if requested. It will not be the original box, as I did not mark the boxes. I am cleaning my closets and will be listing a lot more items. Please check my other listings over the next few weeks for great women's and children's clothes, toys and jewelry. Please email with questions, I won't be able to accept returns. I will combine shipping to the best of my ability. I only charge actual shipping charges. Shipping is expensive. Please consider this when bidding and don't leave negative feedback for something beyond my control.",
