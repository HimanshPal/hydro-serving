  "Description": "My eBay Click on the image below to get zoomed view of the item Store Home Our FeedbackAsk a QuestionItem Description* Exquisitely designed this gold plated waist Sari belt for women from India The Art of Jewellery will certainly add oodles of charm to your feminine look. Made from copper this waist belt is superior in quality and a worthy investment. * Material: Alloy/ Copper Coated with 18K Gold Polish. * 18K Gold micron plating is done on it. * Decorated with CZ stone. * Size: Length : 40 inches and Width : 1inches ( approx.) * Weight : 55 Gms * NOTE: This is an artificial Jewelry and not real gold. CARE FOR GOLD-PLATED :--------------------------------------- * All gold-plated jewelry is made from high quality 18 Ct gold over brass/ copper/ alloy. The 18 Ct means that it has a ratio of gold over alloy content. Gold plate does not tarnish like silver however with wear it will get dirty and is likely to corrode due to individual body chemistry medications moisture chemicals creams perfumes hair products and such like.. * Remember that it is not solid gold and anything the wearer comes into contact with can effect the gold plating. Individual wear and lifestyle can also be a factor. In time and depending on care taken and the amount of wear gold-plated pieces are susceptible to having the gold wearing away. To minimize this:. dust gold-plated jewelry with a soft cloth or wash by hand in warm soapy water rinse and pat dry. Do not rub. Dry immediately; do not leave to soak in water to avoid spotting;. be extra careful with gold-plated jewelry not to scuff; keep separate from other jewelry which may scratch it. Keep protected in a jewelry box;. avoid exposing your jewelry to solvents perfumes hair sprays or other chemicals. Make sure that these are applied and fully absorbed before putting on your jewelry;. oils in skin and sulphur in some knitwear can tarnish jewelry but this can be kept minimal by caring for it;. do not wear your jewelry whilst in bed showering gardening doing housework swimming or at the gym;. keep away from hard surfaces. Bumps and scratches will cause the gold layer to wear away faster;. do not wear gold-plated jewelry all of the time;. put jewelry on last when dressing and take off first when undressing..
