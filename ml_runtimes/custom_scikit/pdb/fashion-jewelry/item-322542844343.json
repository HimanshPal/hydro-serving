This is a beautiful pin. Despite its size however, it is very delicate looking. The colors are terrific and a wonderful addition to your pin collection. For those concerned about the weightiness of the larger pins,place a small piece of felt or thicker fabric behind your blouse and jacket. It works as a stabilizer and doesn't pull on the fabric of your garment. Don't forget it is also a perfect adornment for your evening bag.
