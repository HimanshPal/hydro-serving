HOW TO CARE FOR YOUR NEW JEWELRY Here are some tips I have learned thru out the years (this is good advice for all jewelry types): \u00b7 Never force open lever backs of new earrings. Gently and slowly open back lever of earrings. You can do this a few times to loosen them up. \u00b7 Always keep your jewelry either in boxes or plastic small \u201ccraft\u201d bags. This keeps jewelry from bumping into each other thereby increasing possibility of losing stones. \u00b7 NEVER put perfume on over your jewelry. \u00b7 Don\u2019t drop your jewelry! This jarrs the jewelry and could loosen a stone and eventually loosing one. \u00b7 LOVE AND ENJOY YOUR NEW JEWELRY! PAYMENT POLICY: You may pay via Paypal. All major credit cards accepted.
