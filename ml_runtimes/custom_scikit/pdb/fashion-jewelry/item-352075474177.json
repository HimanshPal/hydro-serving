  "Description": "lktolbert store Description: Magnificent hand-made one-of-a-kind runway demi by Iris G. The choker features a strand of 6 huge clear round lucite beads from which huge faceted clear lucite drops dangle. Each dangle piece is housed in a goldtone filigree cone-shaped sleeve. On each end of this section is a strand of clear faceted bicone lucite beads separated by spacers filled with Aurora Borealis Swarovski crystal spacers. A 3 1/2\" extension chain provides length versatility. The gorgeous coordinating earrings are pierced style. Though large, they are lightweight. The necklace is a heavy, substantial piece, weighing 8.8 ounces. This demi is prettier in hand than in the photos! OMG....I love it! This piece retails for $550! Never heard of Iris G? You won't find her on the web or in chain department stores. Iris G sells her designs to an exclusive clientele that includes very high-end boutiques and celebrities. Each design is one-of-a-kind...no exact duplicates EVER, no assembly lines in China or elsewhere. Each piece is meticulously hand-crafted by the designer herself. Iris G uses genuine Swarovski crystals, quality plastics, and natural gemstones. She often incorporates vintage components into her designs. Iris G enjoys the art, not the fame or name recognition. Iris G does not even bother to sign her jewelry pieces. She occasionally tags a specialty item. Her runway pieces are in huge demand at prices well over my asking prices, and she stays back-ordered for many months at a time. Are you tired of designers originating a handful of designs and having thousands of copies of each mass produced in China? Are you instead ready for a designer who originates thousands of designs and produces each only ONCE, meticulously by their own hand? If you prefer fabulous one-of-a-kind BLING jewelry and accessory items, you will love Iris G!
