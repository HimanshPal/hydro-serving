  "Description": "Beautiful with a purpose! This is a statement piece of jewelry along with holding your glasses. Approx. 40\" long (I am just guessing I will re-measure). The chain itself took me at least a month to complete. If you do not want the chain to hold the glasses I can easily turn it into a necklace (man or woman) One of a kind eyeglass holder!!! I try and use copper as much as possible for the alleged health benefits. My grandmother wore a copper cuff and was still doing yoga and bellydancing into her late 80's with never a hint of arthritis! FREE SHIPPING (United States only) global shipping program The price is a steal not because copper is very valuable but the chain took many hours to complete. The craftsmanship and strength is perfection. No one else will have a holder like this one! The more the copper is handled and exposed to air the more the color will change. You can polish the high spots with a safe polishing cloth. I added a tiny amount of safe green patina (wax based)",
