SHIPPING AND HANDLING FOR THIS ITEM IS FREE ONLY IN THE CONTINENTAL U.S. FOR OTHER COUNTRIES PLEASE SEE EBAY'S GLOBAL SHIPPING PROGRAM. PLEASE GO TO OUR STORE TO SEE MORE UNIQUE SILVER PIECES, FEATURING PENDANTS MADE FROM PERUVIAN BUTTERFLY WINGS, OTHER BRACELETS AND MORE. PAYMENT AND COMBINED SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS In case you purchase more than one item from my store I will combine shipping. If you win multiple items please send us a request for a combined shipping invoice, and wait to receive it before paying, as all items must be paid through a single invoice in order for you to receive a combined rate. The combined rate will depend on the size and weight of the individual items purchased Combined shipping is not automatic due to the variety of items we sell so we must update your invoice manually We allow 4 days from the end of your first item's auction to continue shopping, combine items, and complete payment. Paying within the 4 days allowed will ensure your payment is recorded with eBay, your items ship quickly, and you avoid any eBay automated non payment messages. We do use the eBay automated non payment system to help us with tracking payments which will send you a non payment message from eBay after the 4th day of non payment. This is an eBay message that can be removed and will not hurt your account as long as its paid. Once eBay's automated non payment cases are open we can not combine any more shipping for extra items. Customer satisfaction is very important for me in every eBay transaction. If you have issues with your purchase please contact me through eBay messaging and I will do everything I can to help.",
