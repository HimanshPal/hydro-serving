  "Description": "44 pc NEW Old Stock DESIGNERS Jewelry Lot Earrings Necklaces Brooches Bracelets 44 piece mixed fashion jewelry lot of \u201cnew-old stock\u201d pieces from high-end department stores. Diverse beautiful styles - the jewelry was purchased by one person during the 1980s. She loves shopping for beautiful jewelry above actually wearing it, and has amassed a huge collection to share. The pieces haven't been worn - consequently, they are in excellent, ready to wear condition and perfect for resale! Many are still on original display cards that show original prices. Hundreds of dollars were spent for this collection. I'm offering it for a fraction of the original $$$ cost - excellent value for your money! The 17 jewelry display boxes in the lot are also original. 2 are unmarked, 15 are marked with names of stores where purchased - such as Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Robinson, Bullocks, and Macy\u2019s. There are 20 pairs of earrings, 10 bracelets, 11 Necklaces, 2 brooches and 1 hair barrette. A few pieces are in sets by Capri, Robert Rose and Anne Klein. Most pieces are signed or identified by display cards or boxes. Designers include Ben-Amun, Anne Klein, Ellen Designs, Ann Taylor, Napier, Nordstrom ETC., Edgar Berebi, Erwin Pearl, Robert Rose, Judy\u2019s, Richelieu, Forenza, Capri, Marvella and Catherine Stein. Photos show all of the jewelry and most of the boxes. This beautiful jewelry lot will ship via USPS in a large flat rate box for $18.85. Please feel free to contact me if you have questions.
