  "Description": "This listing is for a brand new Built NY Diaper Bag. I bought it to use as a travel tote, but never used it. My loss is your gain. This is dark blue with colorful dots all over outside, and is orange on the inside. It is made of neoprene. The bag features tote handles, and a strap. The bag has 1 bottle pocket on each side, two 8\" x 9.5\" slip pockets on the back, one 7\" x 10\" pocket on front with velcro flap closure, main compartment features double zipper closure, four 7\" x 8\" slip in pockets on the inside - two on each inside wall. The bag measures 19\"W x 11.5\"H x 5\"D, the strap measures 48\" full length - drop length is 24\" - strap is removable and adjustable. All items come from pet free / smoke free / mold free / clean home. My items are clean, and well taken care of, some items may show signs of normal use, but very minimal unless noted. I only list items that are in good, great, excellent or new condition. I do my very best to describe items as accurately as possible giving as much information that is needed for a positive sale. However if the description doesn't supply all the information you need, please ask. My measurements are as accurate as possible. Majority of my listings are my items I have owned and purchased for my own use. There are a few that I have bought used. Be sure to look at pictures, read full description, purchase details, shipping details, and refund details before purchase. Please please ask questions if you are not sure, I will be happy to help in any way. Items are weighed with all materials needed for shipping, box or envelope, bubble wrap, and fill paper if needed for shipping, because everything adds up.",
