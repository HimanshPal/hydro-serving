  "Description": "This is for a Vintage Buttercup Garment Bag Dating from January 1987 - January 1991 Size is extra long measuring 60\" Long x 19\" Wide x 3-3/4\" Deep The paper tag attached says: \"Vera Bradley\" and inside is stamped \"Formal\" I did not find a sewn in Vera Bradley tag, but the fabric matches their website as well as the style. Not sure if it prototype or just escaped the label. Tried to search the paper tag, but found nothing on history of their tags, so not sure if it's an original old hang tag or one someone added sometime along the way. Fabric feels like it has never been washed. (probably should be when received given the age) Condition is just wonderful. The zipper works well. Has a Velcro closure at the top and an extra loop at the top to hang on a hook and still be able to get your garment out of the bag. Feel free to email if you have any questions. ~Remember to Count Every Blessing~ Please email me with questions BEFORE you bid. I enjoy finding unique and unusual vintage items for my buyers.

Did you ever think about why today is called \"present\" time. Answer is because every moment is a \"gift (present) from God\". Make the most of it! ?For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. John 3:16-18 (ESV)",
