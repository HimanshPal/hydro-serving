E-bay considers a 5 Star feedback standard for all purchases. If for any reason you have any concerns with your purchase(s), please let us know directly and soon after receiving your purchase and we will do our best to work out a solution. Most of our transactions go smoothly as you can see through our great feedback scores however occasionally errors or misunderstandings can occur in our listings so please let us know! Returns and exchanges are accepted however the item must be in the same condition that it was sent. For example it must still have the tags attached and not be worn or laundered. Return shipping is the responsibility of the buyer. All of our packages are tracked domestically and some internationally as well. We combine shipping costs whenever possible so please request an invoice when purchasing multiple items as sometimes the e-bay calculation is higher than our shipping cost and we want to pass the savings back to you.

Please contact us for details. For INTERNATIONAL BUYERS, your purchases are sometimes held at your post office for pick up and additional taxes may be due and payable to them.
