  "Description": "All these Anuschka bags are absolutely beautiful! I recently closed a boutique. Must liquidate my inventory. Items listed are well below retail price. All items are in perfect condition with dust covers included, and free shipping. Ask any questions prior to bidding, as every piece is completely inspected prior to shipping and all sales are final. When I first ordered this I wasn't sure if I would like the bags artwork. Well I was pleasently surprised! It is so much more attractive than I thought it would be, and so many women agree with me! The colors are soft and easy on the eye. And yet again, this bag does so much! First of all, it has 3 mainn compartments. The front and back are both zippered. The center is a magnetic closure. The very front has a slip pocket for phone or glasses AND a side zip pocket to hold either. The front zippered compartment is just that. The center has a slip pocket and an attached key fob. The back zippered compartment has a wall zip pocket. Another easy bag to carry. And never worry about the artwork on the bags fading, chipping or otherwise coming off. Anuschka has been around for over 25 years, and they have this down to a science. They get priettier with age and use!",
