Returns accepted if RECEIVED back in my hands within 10 days of buyer's receipt. Buyer MUST CONTACT ME within 3 days of item receipt with intent to return. Item must be in exact same condition as sent to buyer, with security tags attached. Buyer pays postage both ways plus 15% restocking fee.Please request more information or photos before buying. Sorry, ladies, but I'm an individual not a huge retail store. Capricious returns consume time,fuel and packaging materials; they cost me money. Smoke-free home. I do NOT ship internationally.I am a longtime member of tPF (the Purse Forum) and have been an Ebay member since 1999 and a seller since 2002. I've sold MANY designer items, especially designer high-end purses and shoes. I have earned a 100% positive feedback, a record I am proud of and work hard to maintain. If you have any doubts about any item of mine, I encourage you to authenticate it with an online service such as caroldiva.com, mypoupette.com, etincelerauthentications.com, bababebi.com or other paid service. (LV, Hermes and Chanel boutiques typically will not authenticate any item not purchased directly from their brick-and-mortar or online stores.) Whenever I've been not 100% certain about an item, I've enlisted these expert services myself, so don't be shy about taking that step if you feel uncomfortable with ANY online seller's items!! Finally, if you buy an item of mine and have an issue with my description or its condition, please contact me to resolve before leaving feedback. I'm human and can make mistakes.",
