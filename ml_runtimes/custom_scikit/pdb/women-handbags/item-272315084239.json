  "Description": "Description New Everki Beacon Laptop Backpack with Gaming Console Sleeve, Fits up to 18-Inch (EKP117NBKCT) by Everki Product Description Beacon Laptop Backpack w/Gaming Console Sleeve, Fits up to 18\" Rugged and stylish, the Beacon is designed for comfort even with heavy loads and harsh conditions. An ultra-soft, padded laptop compartment deftly protects and carries up to 18\" laptops while still leaving enough room in the main compartment for a gaming console and accessories. Comfort and balance are maintained, even under heavy loads, thanks to the Beacon's 5-point balance strap system and aero-flow padded back and shoulder harness. The spacious main storage compartment features a large zippered pocket, dividers, and an assortment of multifunction accessory slots. A clever buckle system allows the compartment to open halfway for quick access or a full 180 degrees for easy loading. Gamers will appreciate the inclusion of a dedicated sleeve for taking a gaming console (XBox 360, PS3, or Wii) on the road. Dual hip pockets provide extra storage and quick access to important items like keys, mobile phone, or a media player without taking the bag off. A zippered outer pocket and a quick-stash slot provide additional easy-access storage. To keep your valuable contents protected in all weather conditions, the Beacon has an integrated stow-away water-resistant weather cover for use in sand, snow, rain, or dust. As with all Everki products, the Flight is backed by Everki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Limited Lifetime Warranty and world-class customer service. Features 1.

Ergonomic Back Panel and Shoulder Straps Carrying a laptop, gaming console, and accessories can wear a traveler out quickly.\u00c2\u00a0 Luckily for the weary traveler, the Beacon is designed with pillow-soft shoulder straps and padded back panel that pitch in to help you shoulder the load when you have to carry your gear for long periods of time.\u00c2\u00a0 Mesh padding and deep airflow channels also allow for maximum air circulation to keep you dry, cool, and comfortable, even while you are in constant motion.\u00c2\u00a0 Everki presents the Beacon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s padding and mesh in the same warm, orange tone that lines its interior.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 6.
