  "Description": "Designs by Keri\u00ae Last one! Fabric no longer available so grab it fast No charge to customize! So many ribbon color choices! Medium blue, turquoise, pink, hot pink, khaki, rust, red, and more. Here is a diaper bag even a dad would no be embarrassed to carry! TO PERSONALIZE: EMAIL ME AFTER PURCHASE WITH DETAILS ADD A NAME! No extra charge xlg 14\" tall x 19\" wide x 5\" deep with 31\" handles This diaper bag or tote bag is made with a creme beige fabric and has a great western home on the range scene. Full of cows, steers, horses and cowboys. I have used a coordinating solid chocolate brown for the bottom and handles. This bag has two side gathered pockets. So many ribbon trim color choices that would go great with the bag. Also I have several western embroidery designs you can choose from like the longhorn which you can put a name through. Choice for closure: zipper closure, magnetic snap, button and loop, Velcro, ribbon or a cloth tie. The bag is fully lined and there are 6 interior pockets with pretty embroidered tops, which are perfect for bottles, sunglasses, cellphones, wallets, etc. This is a perfect bag for anyone who loves room for everything! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Most of my items are made after purchase so I can offer customizing such as handle length, your choice of closures and adding a monogram, initials or full name. I can still add name or initials to a completed bag no problem. So I will always be out just a bit in orders Each and every order is important and I will complete yours as quickly as possible. If you are concerned with time, be sure to email me prior to purchase. Also if you have a rush order for a baby shower etc. just email me prior to purchase to be sure I can hurry it out for you. My home is smoke free and I really love what I do. Any questions just email me, I am always here to answer your emails and help you design that special bag for any occasion. All my Bags are made one at a time. No two are exactly a like. All dimensions are approx. I pay special attention to detail and I reinforce all stress points. I use only the very best fabrics and fleece available. I am always searching for new ideas and creating new patterns to keep up with the hottest fashions. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- LEGAL NOTICE: Copyright \u00a9 2001 Designs by Keri LLC.
