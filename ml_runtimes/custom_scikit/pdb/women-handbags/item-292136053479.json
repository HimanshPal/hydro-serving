  "Description": "This is a gorgeous bag that is padded so you can use it with a laptop or iPad and know there's some protection or as a handbag. The quality of this piece is very, very nice and it should please you to own it. I just retired and this needs to go to a good home. Both sides of the bag have exterior slip pockets; perfect for placing your phone in one and keys in the other. Additionally there are two end slip pockets; one on the left, one on the right. The strap drop is comfy to use over your shoulder or in your hand. The straps are attached to decorative leather buckles by silver tone hardware. The footed bottome is also using silvertone hardware which protects the leather on the bottom of this bag. The inside has a padded center divider. On one side of this divider is a large zippered interior pocket with a Fossil embossed tag. On the other side three slip pockets, an id pocket and two zippered mesh pockets - lots of organization. One side of the bag is free of scratches/marks however there are slight scratches on the other side that are not very noticeable unless you look for them. Please look carefully at the pics as they are a vital part of my descriptions. This bag has years of use left in it. I never liked the look of masculine briefcases, therefore I used this because it looks \"smart\", \"chic\" and is extremely well made and was cared for.",
