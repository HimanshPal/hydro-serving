  "Description": "Chanel Black Vintage Quilted Classic \"Diana\" Shoulder Flap Bag All detailed images are photos of the actual bag offered for purchase. If we have more than one of the same model, we will shoot each item individually and will never reuse photos. Details about this item: One of the most sought-after models within the house of Chanel, this timeless classic Patent Leather flap is chic in a Black, beautifully contrasted with 24k Gold Plated and can be dressed both up and down. This style with single chain strap and curved front panel, also known as the \"Diana bag,\" was recently resurrected by Chanel due to its popularity, but not again in this quality and craftsmanship. This style is especially rare and hard to find in Patent Leather. The long single woven shoulder chain can be worn long cross body (as it is a single chain) or doubled up as a short clutch, and the versatility makes it convenient for either work or play. This item is pre-owned and vintage, and a fabulous collectible piece. This item is in excellent condition with very few signs of use. Corners are clean with no signs of rubbing or scuffing. Gold hardware is a deep, yellow gold hardware and shiny. Note: Chanel no longer uses 24k gold to plate their golden hardware as they did with this model. Interior is clean. Please see photos for details. - Chanel classic quilted Patent Leather in Black - Interior lined in Black lambskin - Signature CC classic clasp in gold plated hardware, as with the Chanel chain - Interior has one zipper pocket - Measures 9in.

About Us Long before its inception in 2004, Patina believed in the preservation of luxury accessories and has strongly advocated against counterfeit merchandise being sold in the United States and the rest of the world. Because of the multitude of counterfeit items being sold on and offline, the founders of Patina created consignment services offerings to help promote authentic pre-owned premier handbags in a fierce online selling environment where counterfeit sellers are equipped with more tools and resources to outshine even legitimate sellers of authentic handbags. Most of our items are previously used, and the condition is described in each listing above the bulleted portion of the item's attributes description (last complete paragraph preceding bulleted list in each listing). Boutique Patina is not affiliated with any of these brands or companies, but we sell items purchased from these companies at a previous time, whether it be items purchased directly from branded boutiques or from a department store. We are selective - Patina Consignments is committed to carefully and professionally curating one of the most desirable collection of authentic pre-owned Chanel and Hermes handbags in the United States. Through brand zeal, established reputation, product expertise and an experienced history in selling only pre-owned authentic Chanel, Hermes sand other luxury pieces, Patina will deliver for its customers high quality service, convenience and assurance that their items are being traded for the best value possible in the current marketplace, while offering sellers lower fees than typical consignment or pawn shops with less specialized product knowledge. We look forward to helping you find another home for your luxury items. For inquiries, call or text 714-988-3415 Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.",
