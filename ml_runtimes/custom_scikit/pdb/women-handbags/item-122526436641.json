  "Description": "~Authentic Louis Vuitton Black Epi Leather Lockit Charm~ This mini purse charm is made of dark black Epi leather and matches most hand bags and looks stunning with Damier Ebene. It has a zip closure to keep contents secure such as medicine, key fobs, keys or any small items you'd like to carry and have readily handy. There is a silver LV lock adorning the side. There is a leather strip with two silver clips-one to clip on the Lockit and the other to your hand bag. It measures approximately 3.5\" in height (handles not included) and about 3.2\" in width. The depth is 1.5\". The leather strap measures a little over 5\" end to end. This was a part of my Aunt's collection and was used only several times. Signs of use are very light scratching and some slight discoloration to the silver clips. It is in overall great condition. Please see pictures of the item's condition and ask questions if you have any. Interior is clean. There are no smoke, perfume or odd storage odors. Zipper runs smoothly and clips are in good working order. I guarantee this is authentic Louis Vuitton. It was made in France. This piece was made to celebrate LV's anniversary at Champs in Paris along with about a hundred other miniature bag designs. I accept Paypal and would like payment at sale end. Your item will be shipped by priority mail within one business day of payment and you'll receive it in 1-4 business days. Tracking and signature confirmation are included with free shipping. Returns are accepted for 2 weeks of rec'd date and a full money back guarantee if the security tag is still attached and any accessories as a dust bag, box, tags etc. are returned. If you have any questions, please ask. Price is firm. Thank you.",
