  "Description": "LOT of 8 mixture of NEW & PRE-OWNED MICHE \"CLASSIC\". These are not mine. I have acquired these to sell and have taken the word of the person I got them from that they are either NEW or PRE-OWNED and am listing them as such.

Some of the new ones are in bags and some are not.NEW - \"JAYMA\" SHELL (Red/brown/cream cow). Faux Leather, silver feetNEW - \"JAN'EE\" SHELL (Olive Green.

Faux leather, Croc pattern, silver feet. (I don't see anything wrong with it. In fact if I wasn't told it was pre-owned, I probably would have listed it as new. It looks that good.PRE-OWNED - \"SHEILA\" SHELL (Yellow). Faux leather. Silver feet. (Has some transfer on the bottom part of the shell (see picture). It won't show at all and otherwise looks to be in great shape.PRE-OWNED - \"VIVIAN\" SHELL (Cr\u00e8me with buckle in front). Faux leather, silver feet. (Normal wear and tear on the strap.
