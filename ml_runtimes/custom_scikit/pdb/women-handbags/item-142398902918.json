  "Description": "Authentic Vintage Fendi Pequin stripe and brown leather duffel bag Made in Italy Serial number: A 00464 4 CONDITION: This Authentic Fendi Zucca duffel bag is in pre-owned condition. The exterior FF striped monogram canvas is still looking good, but it has become a bit soft so the bag is not so firm, there are a few marks from previous use but nothing very noticeable. The interior is also looking good, but a bit worn down, so the material has some wrinkles and wear due to the bag being old. The Leather handles look good and all stitching is intact. All the corners look great with some light scuffs and wear.\u00a0 The gold tone hardwear still shines a bit but is also tarnished. The zipped closure functions perfectly. For being a vintage duffel bag it still looks great!
