  "Description": "I have very high standards for the items I sell. I want my customers to be thrilled with quality, value and STYLE! My mother purchased these beauties on a shopping trip to NYC a few years ago. They have been carefully stored since the time of purchase. I was with her and she paid a lot for these adorable bags. Most of the items I list are from estate sales or movie sets. I store everything together in plastic totes in my warehouse to protect from moisture and moths. I have no way of knowing the history of exposure to eg. pets, smoke, fragrance. If you are sensitive buy brand new off the rack and do not risk buying pre-owned. Keep your favorite out of this lot and gift the other three to loved ones on your Christmas list. Hobo bags are very well made. Large Hobo bags sell for about $250. Small clutches go for about $150. This lot has an estimated value of over $800. DEAL! 1) medium brown distressed leather This one has an outside zipper. Three inside pockets. One of the inside pockets has a zipper. Magnetic closure. 9\" across approx. 8.5\" tall and expands to 3\" deep The strap is a little over 50\" long 2) The orange / yellow leather approx. 14\" across 9\" tall 4\" wide base handles are: 12\" 5 pockets inside two of the inside pockets have zippers. a couple of the inside pockets are very large. There is a long strap included: almost 50\" Very roomy bag. It probably sells for over $300! STUNNING! I did not get a photo of the lining but it is beautiful. The lining is an orange cross-hatch pattern 3) red clutch This is designed like a wallet. 5 inside pockets and two sides are credit card holders. Two of the inside pockets are zippered. The leather is heavenly! There is an outside slide in pocket. I have never seen one like it but my cell phone would go right in that pocket should I decide to keep this for ME! I am tempted to ditch my wallet and use this. I would keep it right in my large handbag and just grab this when running into the bank or post office. The strap is over 51\" and clips. This is my favorite of this lot. It has a TASSLE!!! 4) black clutch approx. 10.5\" x 5\" 3 inside pockets and credit card holders two zippered pockets FREE SHIPPING (United States only) global shipping program (If they participate where you reside) This is one of the most amazing listings I have ever had! You will fall in love when you see the quality. Women become devoted to HOBO after their first experience.",
