  "Description": "Let our 3 generations of experience here at Mountain Leather Design, in Chester, Vermont, guarantee you a quality handcrafted purse that will offer years use and enjoyment! All of our products offer a lifetime warranty against manufacturer's defects. This belt is truly a one of a kind! Perfect for all steampunk and renaissance fans. It is made using oil tanned genuine cowhide leather, then we've added our own artistic look utilizing handy pouches with magnetic snap flaps perfect for a phone wallet, and more; zippered pouches, hand tooled decorative cut-out back pieces, etc. Then we add pieces of silk scaves and pieces of up-cycled jewelry such as the druzy and the butterflies... we then finish it all off with the burned in designs. So be sure to check out the close up photos, there's so much to see!!! This belt is incredibly comfortable to wear, with the pouches falling over the hips at 7\" long, and the mid-back section at 4 3/4\" wide. It attaches with a hand-hammered iron ring. We will custom make it in your size! You will need to let us know your measurement at time of purchase, either in the \"note to seller\" area or in an email: ****IMPORTANT: You can obtain a perfect fit by measuring your waist at the place where you will be wearing the belt. YOU MUST MEASURE!!! DO NOT go by your \"pants size\", this is different than your belt size, and will not fit correctly! Once you've measured, simply choose that as your size from the drop down menu, we will take care of the rest for a perfect fit! Returns are costly for everyone and will end up being reflected in the price of our belts, which we try our best to keep reasonable, so please do not order if you are unable or unwilling to measure your waist.",
