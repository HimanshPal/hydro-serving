    "Description": "You should have received a Returns Form in with your order. This will speed up the process of us dealing with your return and explain how to proceed.\nEvery purchase is covered by an exchange or refund warranty within 60 days from the date of parcel shipment.\nIf you fill out the form and return it to us along with the item we will contact you when it is received. If you do not have a copy of the form, return your item along with a note containing your order number and whether you would like a return or refund. These details will ensure your request is dealt with correctly and quickly.\nIf you need to return an item to us, it\u2019s advisable to use a secure and recorded shipping method. This means all goods will come back to us in the same condition you received them, as well as meaning we are able to process your return efficiently. We would not recommend using a courier as this can be expensive and is often unnecessary. \nIf you send an item back to us you're responsible for paying the postage (so use a reasonable shipping method!), unless it's our mistake. If you are sending it back because of an error we've made, we will refund the cost of postage when we receive the return.\n\nFor hygiene reasons, we cannot accept the return of any underwear, boxer shorts, socks, or earrings. Please ensure that you choose your size and style carefully as we cannot offer exchanges or refunds for these items.",
