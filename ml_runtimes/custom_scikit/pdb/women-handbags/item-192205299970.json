You can order one item or many items from our store and the shipping rate will be $4.99. This rate applies to the 48 contiguous states, APO/FPO and P.O. Boxes. Shipping times vary based on location. Once we have received your order it will be processed & shipped within 1 business day and a confirmation email with a tracking number will be sent to the email address you've provided. Restrictions do apply for APO/FPO and PO Box addresses as these addresses do not have expedited shipping options (3-day and 2-day) available. The cost is still just $4.99 on any size order. Unfortunately our carrier does not deliver to Hawaii, Alaska or Puerto Rico; therefore we cannot accept orders from those areas at this time.
