  "Description": "\"Luxury in Leather-Handmade in Germany since 1856\" Available for sale is a new with tags scotch leather briefcase/handbag from Goldpfeil, a company located in Offenbach, Germany that has been making some of the finest leather goods in the world since 1856. This versatile bag has an adjustable leather shoulder strap which is also detachable. The interior has one main compartment and there is also an additional narrow slide in compartment just above the Goldpfeil logo on the front of the bag above the three position lock. Two keys are included with the bag. In the main compartment you will find two leather pen holders, a cell phone pocket as well as three business card pockets. The interior is lined with a high quality tan fabric imprinted with the Goldpfeil logo which is scattered throughout the interior. There is also an inside zippered compartment on the back wall of the interior. On the back of the briefcase is an additional compartment with a snap magnetic closure. This briefcase is first grade and is handmade in Germany with the finest quality German leather. It was purchased by me directly from Goldpfeil in Germany. Due to its size, this bag is extremely versatile and can be used as a ladies handbag or as a ladies briefcase. With its unisex style, this briefcase can also be used by men who prefer a smaller briefcase. The case can also be used as a handy airport carry on as it is the perfect size for airline travel for carrying documents, magazines and as well the bag is a perfect size for an 8.5\" x 11\" notepad. Here are the dimensions: Length: 13.5\" (34.5 cm.) Width: 3\" (7.5 cm.) Height: 11\" (28 cm.) Goldpfeil's Oxford Leather The unique leather used for the Oxford Line is made exclusively for Goldpfeil. The selected skins from stable-fattened bulls from southern Germany-considered by many in the leather goods industry to be the best raw hides in the world are tanned for several months in the pit using natural vegetable substances and then aniline-dyed in the barrel. Their brilliant Oxford finish with its distinctive yet subtle two-tone effect is obtained in a manual process and further stresses the fascinating surface of this valuable leather. All of the models of the Oxford collection are tooled by hand and carefully sewn. For more than 155 years, the perfect craftsmanship of Goldpfeil's fine bag and briefcase makers has stood for an immaculate finish and extreme durability in of all their products. Supreme quality and understated elegance perfectly describes the image, style and quality that Goldpfeil has become famous for worldwide for over a century and a half.
