Imperfection of the leather: Individual leathers display their own natural and unique marks that enhance the characteristics of the products. We usually call these marks as the imperfection of the leather. Especially, the vintage type of leather often has unique characteristics, such as wrinkles, natural scratches, distressed finishing, and rough texture. All these imperfection signs are considered as positive features, not defects. If you are not familiar with certain type of leather, please contact us. Dimensions: Please refer to the link of Measurement Guide for the handbag measurement method we use. An easy way to decide if the size of this bag is suitable is to compare the dimensions of this bag to those of the bags you have. Our measurements may differ from those from other sellers or products\u2019 official measurements. There are two reasons caused such difference: different measurement guide and measurement approximation. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;div style=\"text-align:center\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a style=\"text-decoration:none\" href=\"http://mostpopular.sellathon.com/?id=AC628130\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;img src=\"http://www.sellathon.com/Resources/Images/countercredit.gif\" border=\"0\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/div&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;",
