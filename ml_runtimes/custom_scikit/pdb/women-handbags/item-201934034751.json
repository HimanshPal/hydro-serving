  "Description": "Vera Bradley retired Metro bag aka briefcaseRemovable shoulder strap 2 handles to hold as well Fob for keysOutside slip in pocket and zipper closed pocket2 end slip in pocketsInside 3 slip in pockets and one zippered that is the entire length of the bagHard baseMeasures approximately 11\" x 14.5\" x 3\"Kept in a smoke free environment I am not a Vera Bradley dealer or affiliated with Vera Bradley in any way. However, this item is authentic. I am an avid bargain hunting shopper, when I find a good buy, I make the purchase. In some cases, I pass them along to you. Please make certain to ask any questions prior to the bidding . Buy more than one and get combined shipping. If you purchase more than one item, you must make one payment in order to get the combined shipping price so let me know if there is significant time between auctions and please wait for an invoice before paying. Thank you for stopping by to look!",
