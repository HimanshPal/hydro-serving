It is however, hand-crafted from licensed springs creative products fabric. I am not affiliated with or sponsored by Springs products group Size is aprox: xxlg 15\" tall x 21\" wide x 6\" deep with 31\" handles This adorable gender neutral unisex duffle diaper bag is made with a sweet dreams zoo babies print. There are giraffe, monkeys, zebras, lions, teddy bears, butterflies, elephants and more. I have used a matching coordinating mint green tiny dot for the top and handles and added a yellow grosgrain ribbon trim and a bow between the two fabrics. Best of all it has two outside gathered pockets perfect for a cell phone, baby bottle etc. It has a secure zipper closure. The bag is fully lined and there are 6 interior pockets with embroidered tops, which are perfect for bottles, sunglasses, cellphones, wallets, etc. It has a heavy fleece between the fabrics to make it sturdy and it stands on it's own even when empty. This is a perfect bag for anyone who loves room for everything!
