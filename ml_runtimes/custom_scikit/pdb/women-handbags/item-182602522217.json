  "Description": "Louis Vuitton Papillon Patent Leather Incredible condition for a used older handbag.Perfect for all carrying all your essentials. It was a gift from my mother and I have enjoyed her very much, However it is a new baby crib I am after for my new baby. This handbag has been well cared for. It has been professionally cleaned for this sale. Always in a fabric drawstring bag with filling to prevent slumping when not in use. My mother and I always carry our cosmetics and money in pouches or wristlets thus the interiors of our handbags are always pristine and ready for wear. Whether day use or evening this handbag is perfect for both. There is fraying of the interior piping under the zipper but does not affect the use of this handbag.Also there is a tiny dot on the end of the bag which is barely noticable unless trying to find it. All sales are final. In the event of a descrepancy buyer pays all shipping fees. All my items are authentic and newly cleaned for sale to make this item ready to use. From a clean non smoking, pet free environment. This Louis Vuitton is free from rips, tears, odors and zipper functions normally. Pocket is clean and usable if desired. Exterior is very nice used condition. Interior is very clean, nice condition.",
