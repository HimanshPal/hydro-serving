  "Description": "This is a listing for an Anuschka large hand bag/purse/pocket book. The bag is new with tags and has never been used. We helped a relative move last year, downsizing to a smaller place and this bag was found in storage. So it has been in a closet, but still has the tags on. It is made from real leather and comes with a small bag with a zipper. The pattern is floral with dragonflies on it. After measuring the bag, the measurements are as follows: The height of the bag (without straps) 11 inches The depth of the bag 9 inches The length of the bag 19 inches The distance from the top of the strap to the top of the bag itself 12 inches. I measured these figures more than once, they are as exact as I could get. Shipping will be free. Item is sold as is. Paypal only.If you are out of the USA please contact me, as free shipping might not be available outside of America.I will have another Anuschka bag listed.Any questions please ask.",
