Not as spacious as my previous saddle bag but I like that it's different than your average bag and works great for carrying my 14\" thinkpad, note portfolio, and quite a few other trinkets. Only been using it for a couple of weeks but quality seems durable. Made in Thailand. gatosun from Miami, FL Only missing one thing 4 out of 5 Stars Bought this bag for my husband and he really likes the function of the bag. My husband travels frequently and the only thing missing in his opinion is a water bottle holder on the outside. He had this feature in a previous bag.
