  "Description": "All these Anuschka bags are absolutely beautiful! I recently closed a boutique. Must liquidate my inventory. Items listed are well below retail price. All items are in perfect condition with dust covers included. Ask any questions prior to bidding, as every piece is completely inspected prior to shipping and all sales are final. Yet another one of my favorites! There is only the Dahlia on the front of the bag. Everything else is plain. The colors and detail are breathtaking! And again, this bag does so much! It has the security of an all around zip entry into the main compartment. Opens up really wide so you can see or get to what you need. Has a center main zip pocket. I has 5 seperate sized divider pockets to keep everything in its place. A zippered wall pocket. An attached key fob, also 2 slip in pockets. This is an easy bag to carry. And never worry about the artwork on the bags fading, chipping or otherwise coming off. Anuschka has been around for over 25 years, and they have this down to a science. They get priettier with age and use!",
