  "Description": "VHTF Anthropologie Miss Albright Weekender/Travel/Overnight BagIn very good, lightly used condition.Made of pretty bright green canvas with pink/blue floral pattern.Has wood handles (these are rounded and very comfortable to hold versus many other wood handled bags I've seen/tried). Some light use wear to handles - nothing bad at all, but wanted to point it out.Also has a long adjustable strap.Top zips closed.Lined in a mulberry fabric - looks like cotton. Inside there is a zippered pocket as well as some open pockets to carry smaller items. Interior looks very good - not dirty.Both the trim and strap appear to be real leather, but I could not find a material content tag to verify.Picture #8 shows bottom - very clean.This is a good sized tote.Measurements:Bottom is a reinforced rectangle - measures 22\" x 9\"Bag is 29\" across at widest (where strap attaches on either side) when measured flat - when stuffed with items, it won't measure that wide.About 18 1/2\" from top of zipper to bottom.Strap can be extended to 50\" long, easily adjusted to any length you want. Strap can also be removed and stored inside zippered pouch.Please note, this is an irregular shaped bag - not a perfect rectangle, so measurements are difficult to take. Please ask questions. Please note - I DO combine shipping. I try to use the most economical shipping method for both of us. If you feel shipping is too high, remember that the west coast is very costly from my location in Illinois. Also, I try not to use the USPS flat rate priority boxes since these usually cost more than using priority mail based on weight. However, when shipping heavy items, it's often a better deal to use the flat rate boxes. Items under 16 oz can go first class. I have had it be cheaper to send multiple items separately through first class than combined through priority. I can use parcel post as well, especially for heavy items, but it is slower. I mail out promptly, usually in a day or two, and a tracking number is sent to you automatically. Once it has shipped, I have no control over the post office. If any problems, please contact me prior to leaving feedback and we can work towards a solution. Thanks!! Shipping rates increased dramatically in many categories Jan 2017. Sorry, but I can do nothing about the increases, and I already pass along my shipping discount to you. Thanks for understanding!",
