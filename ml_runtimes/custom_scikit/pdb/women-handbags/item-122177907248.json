CHARACTERISTICS OF HANDMADE LEATHER BAGS-Bag is made of Genuine Goat Leather processed properly left with no smell, tanned with sun flower oil (a traditional method used in India) which makes leather soft and durable.Bag is hand cut, and hand stitched. Each one is individually made pure handmade bag with lasting durability.Each leather satchel is a totally natural product therefore the colors and the finish can vary from one piece to the next.Parts from several hides may be used to make a single leather bag. So there may be some variation in color and the textures to the different parts of a bag, which will create a wonderfully unique effect.Natural lines and marks in the leather are left fully exposed. There may also be visible creases in the leather. These features go to show the genuine origin of our leather satchels and messengers bags, they form part of the bag and not affect its durability.Our leather bags are handmade and your new leather bag may be subject to natural variation in its size.All this simply enhances the unique appearance of your bag and adds extra character.
