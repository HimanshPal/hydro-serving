Buy with confidence. I am not a certified expert & have described the item to the best of my knowledge and ability. Sometimes when writing up descriptions details can be overlooked so, I encourage questions prior to bidding or buying. Feel free to ask any questions about the product. These are actual pictures of the item that will be shipped & not a stock picture. All measurements are approximate. Comes from a smoke & pet free environment. Don't forget to look at the other items we are selling, you might find something you've been looking for. Shipping It's the buyer\u2019s responsibility to make sure I have a valid and confirmed shipping address. The above cost is for US mainland addresses only. Shipping costs to Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico might be additional, please ask before bidding or buying. Otherwise, upon winning, you are agreeing to pay additional costs for the shipment. I also ship international. Please contact me for shipping charges before bidding or buying it. If you need expedited shipping, do send me a message with your zip code & the item # that you want to buy. I'll let you know the estimate for the same. If you only have a P.O. Box address, please send me a message with your zip code & item # that you want to buy to see if it can be shipped at the same shipping cost as listed. This is because I can only ship via USPS to P.O. Box addresses & sometimes it costs much more than FedEx or UPS (they don't deliver to P.O. Box addresses). For local pick-up I'll only accept cash payment on delivery. Let's try to resolve the issues if any, before leaving any negative feedback. Please remember that both buyers & sellers make eBay the great platform that it is & if buyers leave an unjustified negative feedback or picks an incorrect reason to open a case, the seller has a right to report that buyer to eBay. Unpaid items are automatically set to open a case if payment is not received in 4 days. If the item is over $250 signature is required on delivery & the service is included in the price of shipping (not for international shipping). It's also to give a heads-up that someone needs to be home to sign for the package upon arrival. Product Return Terms I should get an eBay message from you within 2 days of the item being delivered stating that you wish to return the item. It should be in the same condition it was sent in i:e as listed since these are the pictures of the actual items that will be shipped & not stock pictures. Items should be unworn & unused. When present, the original tags should not be found to be reattached else the return policy stands void. Buyer pays return shipping & 10% restocking fees. Returns accepted only for USA buyers. No returns accepted for international buyers. For International buyers Please note that you would be responsible for any export/customs duties or any other fee incurred in your country. The shipping charges listed or quoted to you only include shipping charges. Also, a phone number is a must to ship internationally. I will NOT ship unless I have the buyer's phone number. My preferred mode of shipping will be by USPS Priority International Mail (except for Canada).",
