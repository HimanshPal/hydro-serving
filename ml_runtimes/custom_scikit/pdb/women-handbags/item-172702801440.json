  "Description": "Here is a beautiful chocolate brown suede Beguelin bag. Zippered closure, bridle leather handles. This bag has been carried with love. Typical for a Beguelin the leather will show light surface scratches and marks as sign of patina. These bags are handmade for many years of service. This bag is not new but in very good condition, showing some wear. Please look at pictures and ask questions if you have concerns. Approximate measurements: handle drop 10.5\", deep (on bottom) 5.5\", and about 9\" tall. Very nice, only selling because I am moving to a much smaller place and have to downsize. Please take a look at my other high quality items, many new or barely worn--great bargains!! I am only selling to a confirmed PayPal address within the US. Please ask all questions before, as I don't accept returns. I am trying to describe all items as accurate as possible and take pictures that show the item well. If there are any issues, please contact me so we can find a solution. If you have less than 10 positive feedbacks, please contact me before committing to buy. Thank you for looking!!",
