  "Description": "MUST READ: This item was donated, and what a delightful find! Items are tested, if possible, if it doesn\u2019t say \u201ctested\u201d please assume it\u2019s not and what you are buying is what is photo'd (AS IS). There are no additional warranties or implications with anything we sell. We are a belief based operation and believe in doing things honestly. We add shipping insurance generally to everything . We also collect sales tax if you are in Texas . This is a Laurex Floral Pattern Laptop Backpack. Very little wear, See photos. We are a non-profit resale shop in Southeast Texas owned and operated by St. Marks Episcopalian church and its volunteers and employees. We have been a huge part of the community donating all our profits to other non-profits locally for 60 years. We are new to ebay. We are also ran by a small staff and small volunteer base, if you do not get an email immediately or even by the end of an auction \"OUR APOLOGIES\". We combine shipping, we refund shipping differences and we ship quickly. We do not have room to store items once they are paid for, thus our ships in 5 days policy. We also ask that you pay for your items promptly (within 3 days please) with paypal. With all this said, PLEASE do not leave negative feedback until we have exhausted all issue with a purchase, we don't make a practice of this and we would appreciate understanding in our operation and how its run. We try our best to work with you to rectify any issues that may occur. We DO include shipping insurance on everything shipped. If any damage occurs during shipping, and we hope nothing happens, but it does happen, you can file a claim with USPS or UPS if there is any damage during shipping. AS stated we refund additional shipping after shipment, we combine shipping, this is proof in our feedback from happy buyers!! We appreciate your business, and hate that we have to be so firm, but these are lessons learned from our short time on ebay. All items are donated to us and photoed in great detail with only what we feel to be the most accurate descriptions. If you have any question please ask!! Thanks so much, Treasure House staff and volunteers",
