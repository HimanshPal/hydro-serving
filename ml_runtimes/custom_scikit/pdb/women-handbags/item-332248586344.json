  "Description": "Chanel Black Lambskin Jumbo Quilted Classic 2.55 Flap Bag All detailed images are photos of the actual bag offered for purchase. If we have more than one of the same model, we will shoot each item individually and will never reuse photos. Details about this item: This Chanel classic jumbo flap with 24k Gold Plated CC's from the timeless quilted classic collection is available for sale. The jumbo classic flaps are one of the most popular models from all of Chanel's models, and currently retails for $5,500.00 + tax in stores. This model year is particularly popular with Chanel enthusiasts as the structured panels prevent slouching and the gold plated hardware attributes - all attributes that are no longer available. The 24k Gold Plated CC closure is a great complement to the Black lambskin. This item is in excellent condition with very few signs of use. Corners are clean with no signs of rubbing or scuffing. Gold hardware is a deep, yellow gold hardware and shiny. Note: Chanel no longer uses 24k gold to plate their golden hardware as they did with this model. Interior is clean.

Returns Policy For pre-owned (not New) Chanel bags: If you are not satisfied with your purchase, you may return your item for a refund within three (3) business days of receipt of your item. The item must be the same condition in which it was received by you and our tag must still be on the bag. If there is no tag (which we secured and is tamper-resistant) on the bag, we will not accept the return. This tag is necessary for two reasons: - To ensure that the item sent back to us is the exact same item you received - To ensure that the next customer who purchases the item gets the item in the same condition - unworn since photographs were taken We will accept returns for Ebay customers for pre-owned Chanel bags as long as the rules above are met.

Of course, authenticity is a lifetime guarantee with no expiration to claim our double your money back guarantee. About Us Long before its inception in 2004, Patina believed in the preservation of luxury accessories and has strongly advocated against counterfeit merchandise being sold in the United States and the rest of the world. Because of the multitude of counterfeit items being sold on and offline, the founders of Patina created consignment services offerings to help promote authentic pre-owned premier handbags in a fierce online selling environment where counterfeit sellers are equipped with more tools and resources to outshine even legitimate sellers of authentic handbags. Most of our items are previously used, and the condition is described in each listing above the bulleted portion of the item's attributes description (last complete paragraph preceding bulleted list in each listing). Boutique Patina is not affiliated with any of these brands or companies, but we sell items purchased from these companies at a previous time, whether it be items purchased directly from branded boutiques or from a department store. We are selective - Patina Consignments is committed to carefully and professionally curating one of the most desirable collection of authentic pre-owned Chanel and Hermes handbags in the United States. Through brand zeal, established reputation, product expertise and an experienced history in selling only pre-owned authentic Chanel, Hermes sand other luxury pieces, Patina will deliver for its customers high quality service, convenience and assurance that their items are being traded for the best value possible in the current marketplace, while offering sellers lower fees than typical consignment or pawn shops with less specialized product knowledge. We look forward to helping you find another home for your luxury items. For inquiries, call or text 714-988-3415 Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.",
