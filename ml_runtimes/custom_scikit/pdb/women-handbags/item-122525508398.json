  "Description": "I purchased this bag about at the Burberry Store at Tysons corner Mall in Virginia, they had to order it from one of the Burberry stores in NY because it was a limited edition bag. There is a story behind this bag. I was in search of my first authentic designer bag...a bag that would be eyecatching and timeless, kind of like a love at first sight search. Well, when I laid eyes on this bag, this was it for me. I knew I would not regret paying over $1,200 for it at the time. Well, I have used it very well, It has pretty much been from my arms back in the dust bag since I purchased it and I can count how many times I've used it. I dont even think its been up to 20 times I've carried it (I have lots of bags). DESCRIPTION:AUTHENTIC BagShoulder Strap length 14 inchesHeight: 9 inches Width: 18 inchesDepth: 5 inchesMaterial: House Check Canvas and Patent Leather Dark Brown (with a hue of Olive color when the sun hits it)Hardware: Gold Tone Zipper and Buckles with Burberry written on them.

Also, I travel a lot and things get misplaced. If you purchase it, you can take it to a burberry store to confirm its authenticity. Thanks and happy Ebaying!!!",
