  "Description": "Designs by Keri\u00ae No charge to customize! This is for an xlg diaper bag or tote but if you want a smaller or larger one, just email me and I can set up a listing for you. PERSONALIZE: EMAIL ME AFTER PURCHASE WITH DETAILS ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Many color choices for ribbon trim and name. cute bag made with a red fabric that has Hello Kitty and hearts in diamonds. I have used a solid black for the top and handles. This one shows a red swiss dot grosgrain ribbon tri and bows but there are alot of other colors that would look so cute. Like black with white dots. Solid red, black, white etc. Best of all it has two outside gathered pockets perfect for a cell phone, baby bottle etc. Add a name to the bag no extra charge. Choose your closure: Zipper, magnetic snap, Velcro, button and loop, ribbon or a cloth tie. The bag is fully lined and there are 6 interior pockets with embroidered tops, which are perfect for bottles, sunglasses, cellphones, wallets, etc. It has a heavy fleece between the fabrics to make it sturdy and it stands on it's own even when empty. This is a perfect bag for anyone who loves room for everything! Matching accessories available for purchase Choose a make-up bag, wallet, changing pad, pencil case, check book cover or change purse and more, all can be matched to your bag. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Most of my items are made after purchase so I can offer customizing such as handle length, your choice of closures and adding a monogram, initials or full name. I can still add name or initials to a completed bag no problem. So I will always be out just a bit in orders Each and every order is important and I will complete yours as quickly as possible.
