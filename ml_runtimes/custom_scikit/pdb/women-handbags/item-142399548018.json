  "Description": "The Piece This amazing quality piece of workmanship is hand carved throughout. The Jadeite is untreated and features a natural pale green and deep brown color. The piece depicts 3D carved Duck swimming with a lotus stem and lotus pod. Symbolism found in Chinese Culture Mandarin ducks (yuanyang \u9e33\u9e2f or xi \u9e02) are believed to mate for life and, therefore, a pair of mandarin ducks symbolize fidelity, conjugal affection, peace and prosperity.A lotus stem and lotus pod shown together symbolize marital harmony and sexual union.Lotus seeds (lianzi \u83b2 \u7c7d) have the hidden meaning of \"continuous birth of children\" because the lian sounds like \"continuous\" (\u8fde) and the zi has the same pronunciation as the word for son or child (zi \u5b50). The carving is extremely detailed and evident of Chinese craftsmen, specifically Stone cutters.The pendant measures just about 1 and 1/4\" tall by 1 and 3/4\" wide by 1/2\" thick. Comes with a 11\" long weaved strap connected by a jade ring. This piece can either be displayed on a wooden stand or worn as a pendant necklace or carried as a purse charm for good luck. Chinese Stone cutters were considered some of the finest artisans in the world during the Vintage Era. They would carved western themes as well as the more rare traditional eastern themes into their many pieces.It was in China\u2014where the gem-carving tradition was already thousands of years old\u2014that jadeite reached its peak as an important artistic medium. The first jadeite reached China in the late 1700's, and late eighteenth and early nineteenth century carvers created masterpieces that are still unsurpassed in concept, design, and technical execution. Antique and Vintage jewelry is disappearing at alarming rates. Unfortunately, most of the jewelry from this time period has been lost over the years, please don't miss your chance to own this special piece of history! Photos show actual item and depicts item's condition. Piece is sold as is and no returns will be accepted so please ask all your questions and look over photos carefully before buying.
