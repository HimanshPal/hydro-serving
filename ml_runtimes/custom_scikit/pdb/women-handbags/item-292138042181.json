  "Description": "For sale is a MARC BY MARC JACOBS handbag! LIGERO style - the NEWEST style of this bag! COLORBLOCK style - pale blue front with tan/brown back/sides/bottom Gold tone graved hardware Snap main compartment Inside has 1 zip & 1 slip pocket Removable, adjustable crossbody strap EXCELLENT condition! Only used once! This bag measures approximately: 13\" x 13\" x 4\". Strap drop approximately: 8.5\" & 23+\". I am describing this bag exactly as it is, and therefore there are no returns. PLEASE ASK ALL QUESTIONS BEFORE BIDDING!!!! I prefer paypal, but I also accept checks. You MUST make me aware if you are an international bidder; some items I will NOT ship internationally!! Payment is expected within 7 days of the auction's end. Take advantage of this great gift and happy bidding!! Please look carefully at the dimensions and descriptions of this item! Please do not consider my measurements to be exact. Measurements given are always approximate, and are not cause for a return. These photos might not represent the actual size of the item. The photos might not show exactly the true colors of the item due to the calibration between the actual item, the camera, and your computer monitor. These are selectively acquired, pre-owned items. Most are not brand new, unless specified, and have at least one previous owner unless specifically stated in the description. We display a lot of pictures, most of them are super-sized, and describe the items as accurately as we can. However, it is truly impossible to describe every single spot, scratch, ink pen marks, or any of the natural blemishes inherent in previously owned goods. As with all my items, this is a FINAL sale! Absolutely NO returns, discounts, or exchanges for any reason, and please do not ask me to deviate from this policy! I apologize, but I am NOT a retailer. I have an ebay store because I have a lot of personal items to list for sale, but I simply CANNOT afford to offer returns/exchanges for ANY current or past customer, and regardless of the number of items purchased, or any other reason. I do understand that buying online is VERY difficult, especially when you have never seen the item in person! Therefore, I do NOT recommend buying online from a seller who does not accept returns unless you are willing to take the risk and don't mind reselling the item yourself if it does not work out for you.",
