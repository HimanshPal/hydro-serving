  "Description": "Vera Bradley's Metro (or Metropolitan) bag was initially sold as a portfolio bag, geared toward businesswoman who carry around file folders and legal documents. It's large enough (and has a zipper) so it can be used to hold a laptop or a laptop inside of a laptop sleeve. The strap is long and the clasps are plastic, so it's lightweight, unlike many laptop or portfolio bags. There's a front pocket with a key fob and clip to hold your keys and plenty of pockets and zippers inside and in the back. Sherbet Vera Bradley Metro Bag All of my items are smoke-free and pet-free and stored in odorless protective plastic containers. Some are with tags and some are without. A couple no longer have the baseboards (most customers remove them anyway). Since this is my new store I am only permitted to list 20 items per month, so please choose carefully. I can't do returns yet and I can't make special listings. I can modify listings so if you want more than one, message me before checking out. I offer combined shipping. Please message me BEFORE you purchase to ask the combined shipping price. I can't do anything to alter shipping once it's been purchased.",
