To save you money, I will be happy to combine Shipping & Handling Charges for multiple auctions. If you intend to bid on any of my auction, just let me know, and also when your buying is complete. At that time, I will send you a revised invoice that reflects discounted shipping & handling charges. Sometimes eBay's combined shipping discount calculator does not correctly calculate the correct weight of the combine packages, resulting in an inflated shipping rate. In those cases I will reissue a corrected invoice. Please wait for me to sent the revised invoice with the corrected shipping charges. If you do pay the invoice with the higher shipping price, I will refund the difference to your Pay Pal account. Feel free to contact me using eBay\u2019s message system if you have any questions, or for exact combined shipping charges.

E-Checks can take up to 4 business days to clear. Your item(s) will ship USPS Priority Mail (normal delivery time 2-3 Business days) or USPS Standard Mail (3-10 business days), your choice. If your package weights less that 13oz I will also offer 1st Class Mail as a less expensive alternative. Please note that in order to serve you best I offer more than one shipping method for you to choose from. Shipping charges, when applicable, are calculated on total package weight, sometimes less (I pay the difference), never any Handling Fees. And remember, I am always more than happy to combine shipping to save you money. Also, think \u201cGreen\u201d. I am very ecology minded.
