Please read below policies carefully prior purchase or bidding. QUESTIONS:\u00b7 Please read the item description before buying! If you didn\u2019t read and now requesting a return because you don\u2019t like what you bought, you will be subject to 20% restocking fee. Shipping and handling costs are non-refundable.\u00b7 Feel free to contact me with any questions. MERCHANDISE:\u00b7 According to eBay policy, \u201cNew with Tags\u201d can refer to an item in its original package with or without tags. Many items I order, especially from Victoria\u2019s Secret, come in plastic packages as opposed to having retail store tags. To avoid confusion, in my Descriptions I state new in original package if the item is in it\u2019s original package without tags.\u00b7 Images of the listed item often can be illustrative only, since I don\u2019t unpack every single item to take a picture of it especially when I sell more than one item of the same kind.\u00b7 I do my best to describe the item as accurately as possible, if you need more info, or another picture, please ask.\u00b7 From pet and smoke free environment. SHIPPING AND HANDLING:\u00b7 Please remember, shipping charges are not only for the postage to ship item but also may include other expenses such as packing materials and getting your package to the post office.\u00b7 If you want expedited shipping or extra insurance, please let me know before paying so I can send updated invoice to you.\u00b7 I am not responsible for any items lost, stolen or damaged while in transit.\u00b7 All items are shipped to the address provided on your eBay/PayPal account.\u00b7 All items are shipped within 1-3 business days of payment. INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:\u00b7 I ship internationally, but please be aware that it takes longer for the package to reach international address. In some cases it can take 6-8 weeks due to delays in customs clearance. If you do not receive your package after the estimated delivery time, I suggest contacting your local customs office to see if they have your package.\u00b7 International buyers are responsible for any import taxes that your country\u2019s customs office may charge you. Refused and returned packages will be subject to 20% restocking fee. Shipping and handling costs are non-refundable. PAYMENT: \u00b7 PayPal preferred. All sales are final.\u00b7 Payment is due within 2 days of auction end as per eBay rules. No exceptions! \u00b7 If no payment is received and no communication, a non-payment case will be opened automatically and the item may be re-listed. FEEDBACK:\u00b7 My feedback rating is very important to me. Please do not leave negative or neutral feedback because you merely do not like the item or have buyer\u2019s remorse as this is not polite and you would not want it done to you.\u00b7 I strive for 5 star customer service. If not satisfied with a purchase, let me know right away! We can resolve problems if we know they exist. Do not hesitate to contact me!\u00b7 I will leave you positive feedback after you leave it for me, please!",
