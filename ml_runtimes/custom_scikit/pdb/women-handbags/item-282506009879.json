Purchases totaling $250 or more ship insured and with signature confirmation. I ship Monday through Friday, except holidays or vacation times, to your Paypal address. I am unable to ship to an address other than that listed on your eBay and Paypal accounts as this action negates Paypal protection policies. If you would like your purchase sent to a different address, please change the ship to address when paying for the item. I ship within 24 hours, so you get your item(s) quickly. If you purchase multiple items, please request a combined invoice before making payment. Please be aware that if you have recently moved, you must change your address in eBay as well as Paypal. I ship to FPO-AP Military addresses. U.S.Returns: If you would like to return an item, please contact me via the eBay messaging system. The return must be shipped back to me within 30 days of receipt. Buyer pays return shipping.

Item must be returned unused, with tags attached, and any applicable material (dustbag, care card, etc) intact. Communications: I only respond to messages sent to me via the eBay messaging system. Communication directly to my e-mail address ends up in the junk folder. Feedback: I will leave feedback for you once I've received your feedback. Your feedback lets me know you received the item and are happy with it. If you are unhappy with your purchase, or any part of the transaction, please let me know via the eBay messaging system. Satisfaction guaranteed. International Buyers: Import duties, taxes, and charges are not included in the item price or shipping cost. These charges are the buyer's responsibility. Please check with your country's customs office to determine what these additional costs will be prior to bidding or buying. All measurements are in inches. Due to the cost of International shipping, it is impractical to return items. Please choose wisely. I neither represent nor work for any of the brands I sell. I strive to deliver top notch service and a top quality, authentic product.",
