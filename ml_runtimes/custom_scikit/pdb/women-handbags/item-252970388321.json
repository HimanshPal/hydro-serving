Backcountry began in 1996 with two guys and a stack of avalanche beacons in an apartment in Park City, Utah. Our roots were humble, but our vision was clear: to provide the best outdoor gear to connect people with their passions. Sometimes, even the path less traveled can feel well worn, so we make our own way. We owe it to ourselves and our customers to be innovative, to take risks, and to reach remarkable new territory. Today, we offer a broad selection of gear from premium outdoor brands, we back that gear with guaranteed returns, and our shipping is lightning-fast. We have deep roots in Utah, and we thrive on the trails and in the mountains surrounding Park City. Our corporate headquarters sits just north of old town Park City and within a quick pedal or a few footsteps of the Wasatch mountains.
