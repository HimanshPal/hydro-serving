Attention The product pictures may not show the exact color of the item due to the wide range of computer monitors and color displays and the lighting conditions etc. We post as many pictures of the item as possible in order to give you the better idea of exactly what it looks like. However, it is difficult to show every angle of each item. We mainly post the pictures of smudges, scratches, dirt, and stains found on the item. Therefore, we will not accept these factors as a reason for your return request. Please also note that accessories that do not appear in the product pictures are not included. We sell pre-owned, secondhand items. Therefore, please note that the returns will not be accepted for reasons such as \"Item is used\". Some of the used items may have an odor or smell that you find unpleasant. Please note that we do not consider these odors to be a valid reason for returns.

Please do not confuse them for additional shipping charges. Please check with the local customs office of your country of residence prior to making purchases to have an idea of what these additional costs would be.
