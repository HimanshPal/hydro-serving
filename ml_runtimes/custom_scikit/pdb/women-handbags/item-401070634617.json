The top does not open wide enough and since it is narrower at the top than at the bottom, the handle actually slants in toward the opening making it very difficult to reach in. If I needed it occasionally for a travel carry on, it would work. jcnorthcarolina from Matthews, NC Excellent bag 4 out of 5 Stars I've had this bag for about 3 years now. Still use it. It has been very durable. jaime m. Awful......had to return after first use. 1 out of 5 Stars The strapes broke on first trip and I only had my laptop in it!! daydreams11 from FL Very Bulky 1 out of 5 Stars I was very disappointed in this order. The case is way larger than it appears and looks very cheap. workngrl from Florida This bag has been awesome, the quality is great! 5 out of 5 Stars This bag has been so great and its much bigger than I thought. I've been looking for a fashionable bag on wheels for sometime now that was reasonably priced. It even came with removable accessories, I get nothing but compliments and I use it for school and work. This is even a good bag to go away on the weekends. traceyga from Newnan, GA Try These Other Categories Bedding Furniture Crafts Rugs & Carpets Health & Beauty Camping & Hiking About Us...
