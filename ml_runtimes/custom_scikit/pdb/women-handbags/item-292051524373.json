  "Description": "Handsome vintage RALPH LAUREN Blackwatch Keepall with strap and accessories! Authentic, as always!! Looks great swinging on your arm and will help you travel more stylishly! A size that will hold quite a bit and includes the always convenient shoulder strap - put it over your shoulder to make travel easier! A bag not seen often, so you won't see anyone else with \"your\" luggage...and that's a great feeling! Perfect for ladies or gentlemen. This would be a perfect piece for your weekend holiday! Measures 18 x 10 x 8\" approx. All presents nicely - not perfect or as brand new - but lots and lots of service ahead for you. Rolled leather handles feel great in your hand! Strong leather throughout - although the strap shows a bit more wear - see and enlarge pictures. Includes the leather tag as well as a brush which are attached. The strap is removable if you prefer. The body of the bag looks great - adore the blackwatch plaid! Classic! Inside is beige textile - overall clean - a hint of storage smell - but should air in the sunshine - and that process has been started! Strap drops 19\" and is 1.25\" wide. Vintage piece - it has seen travel to wonderful places - but always pampered and well taken care of! There will be a bump or smudge here and there, but all presents super! It's such a joy to carry and travel with...rare design and style...super handsome! Charming bag...a breeze to carry! Will be a great addition to your luxury luggage ensemble! Something super special about a vintage piece...discontinued long ago, so you can't just walk into the boutiques and find it! Take this opportunity to become it's caretaker! Last picture shows a matching RL Bucket Bag in Blackwatch - available now separately - they make a fantastic set! P.S...so many wonderful luxury things available now...more always on the way!
