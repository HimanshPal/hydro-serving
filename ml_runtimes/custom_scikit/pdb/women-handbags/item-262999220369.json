Vegetable tanning is the process by which the animal skin, or rawhide, is converted into non-degradable leather through the use of natural vegetable extracts. All of Old Angler\u2019s leather comes from the Conceria il Gabbiano, one of Tuscany\u2019s most qualified \u201cconcerie\u201d or leather tanneries, where experienced artisans oversee the tanning of the leather. The Conceria il Gabbiano is part of the Consorzio Vera Pelle Italiana Conciata al Vegetale and guarantees the production of a high-quality leather that is completely natural, unique and durable. The vegetable tanning process, in which the famous 'vachetta' or Florentine leather is created, is completed in three long and complicated phases.
