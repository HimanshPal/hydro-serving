  "Description": "This diaper bag is in good used condition. I received it as a shower gift and used it a few times. It is so beautiful that I was afraid if I used it too much it would become worn. As a new mom, its hard to imagine life when you won't need a diaper bag anymore and I had this idea I would need a nice bag always. It does not have a changing pad. It can also be used as a lap top or overnight bag. The inside of the bag is extremely clean, it is in excellent condition with no spills, odors or stains. I don't think a dirty diaper was ever within a mile of this bag and its clean and odor free. The outside has some stains and a small tear, please see the last photo. The stains are from being in storage and do not overly detract from the beauty of this bag. They are clearly visible up close but not from a distance or in these photos. The bag has many pockets and compartments to hold all the things a baby needs for a happy, successful outing. There is a long over the shoulder strap and two hand straps. The over the shoulder strap is adjustable so mom or dad can comfortably and safely hold baby while wearing the bag as a cross body. Several changes of clothes, toys, milk, diapers, snacks, baby wipes, your wallet, cell phone and car keys can all have a place to go and easily accessed. Perfect for a new mom who doesn't want to give up being stylish and on trend just because she had a baby. Included is the original Coach paperwork which is also a coupon for their 2007 summer collection; a neat thing to have if you are a collector of Coach as I am.
