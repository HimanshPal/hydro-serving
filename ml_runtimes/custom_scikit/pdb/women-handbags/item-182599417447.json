  "Description": "Up for sale is a pre-owned authentic Prada canvas backpack. This heavy duty backpack has a very large capacity. It's a great bag for school, traveling, hiking, picnic and things alike. This bag is in good used condition. There are some stains both inside and outside of the bag as shown in the photos. I also just noticed that there is one missing stitch on the top leather handle as shown in the last photo. Please review all the photos closely for more details. P. S.: I also have several other Prada bags on sale right now. Please check them out if you like. MEASUREMENTS (approx.): 13.5\" H * 13\" W * 7\" D FYI: Serious Buyers Only. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me. All the items are from our smoke free and pet free home, plus I hate being messy:) PAYMENT: PayPal. Please complete the payment within 24 hours after the auction ending. We know it isn't a problem for serious buyers. Or just simply let us know if you can't make it in time. Otherwise we'd follow eBay's Non-Paying Bidder Policies. SHIPPING: Expedited shipping ONLY to the lower 48 states in the US. Shipment will be made usually within 1 business day after payment. INTERNATIONAL BUYERS Please Note: Import duties, taxes and charges are not included in the item price and shipping charges. These charges are the buyer's responsibility.
