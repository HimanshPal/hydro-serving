Like all our products, each item is individually Made in Montana,USA.All leather-no cardboard fillers, and will last for years.Allow two weeks for special orders. NOTE: Due to Ebay's new unrealistic return policy, we have had to check the \"No Returns\" box. However, we do accept returns and exchanges under the same policy we always have, and do on all our other sales outlets. Just notify us within 3 days that you are returning the item. Once we have recieved the item unused, and in a timely fashion, a full refund of the purchase price will be credited to the buyers PayPal account. Buyer pays shipping. We reserve the right to refuse unauthorized returns. Be sure to check out our E Bay store for more briefcases and other fine products. And remember- long lasting leather products are environmentally friendly. No hydrocarbons,and since they won't need replaced as often as throwaway items,are more energy efficient ,since less energy is used for production and transportation. We ship to UK and most Euopean countries.Note to international buyers-BE SURE TO CHECK ON APPLICABLE IMPORT OR CUSTOMS FEES before purchasing- the purchaser is responsible for these,not the seller.",
