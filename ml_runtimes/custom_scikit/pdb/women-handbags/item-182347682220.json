Once you open the Return, our Customer Service will reply appropriately based on a case-by-case basis. We will provide a Return Authorization for your return as well as a return shipping label if the situation deems it necessary. A return shipping label will only be provided if the return is MyOfficeInnovations' issue.\n \nYou must have a Return Authorization number (RA #) prior to returning goods. Our Customer Service team will issue you the RA # and provide you with a distribution center address where the product is to be returned. PLEASE WRITE THIS RA # ON THE SHIPPING LABEL SO WE CAN ENSURE YOU ARE CREDITED PROPERLY. Shipping charges for delivery and/or return of items will be credited only if we are responsible for the error.\n \nWe are not responsible for items that do not arrive at our warehouse. Therefore, we strongly suggest that you ship your package in a way that allows you to track the shipment and receive proof of delivery.\n \nAll returned products must be in original condition and packaging; otherwise, additional charges may be applied. Unfortunately, we cannot take returns of products that have been assembled or modified. Additionally, certain products cannot be returned because neither we nor our suppliers can take them back. If you have any questions about whether a product can be returned, please call us.\n \nGovernment regulations prohibit the return of food and drug products.",
