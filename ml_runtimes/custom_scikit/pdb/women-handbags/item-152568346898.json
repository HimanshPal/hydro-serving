  "Description": "Vera Bradley's Tall Zip Tote was introduced as a Book Bag, an alternative to a crossbody messenger bag or an over-the-back backpack which can be hard on the back. The straps are long enough to carry this like a purse and the main zipper compartment is deep enough to carry quite a few large hardcovers or binders. There are two front magnetic flap pockets to put your supplies in and one zipper compartment in the back to store peripherals or your daytimer. This is a cute bag, one of Vera's most popular. Calypso Vera Bradley Tall Zip Tote All of my items are smoke-free and pet-free and stored in odorless protective plastic containers. Some are with tags and some are without. A couple no longer have the baseboards (most customers remove them anyway). Since this is my new store I am only permitted to list 20 items per month, so please choose carefully. I can't do returns yet and I can't make special listings. I can modify listings so if you want more than one, message me before checking out. I offer combined shipping. Please message me BEFORE you purchase to ask the combined shipping price. I can't do anything to alter shipping once it's been purchased.",
