  "Description": "~Authentic Louis Vuitton Trunks and Bags Tinkerbell Coin Purse, Dust Bag, Box~ This pretty Louis Vuitton coin purse was released as a part of the Tinkerbell collection. The Vernis leather has the major Louis Vuitton stores printed on it along with its Trunks and Bags signature. It clips onto a hand bag with the key clip and can carry coins, medicine, keys, money or other small items you would like easily accessible. The zipper keeps your items secure. The exterior is Vernis leather and the interior is cow hide leather. The key clip is compressed golden brass. Louis Vuitton sold this as \"green\" but it is really a yellow color and matches Monogram, Damier Azur and Damier Ebene patterns. This is pre-owned and has slight signs of use. The very bottom of the interior has some scratch marks and there are glue stains on the zipper fabric where the Vernis meets the fabric. This is due to heat exposure. The Vernis is in excellent condition-no transfer marks or discoloration and the key clip is excellent. Please examine pictures and ask questions as I'm happy to answer. It was made in France and has the date code inscribed on the interior SN0027. Measures 4.2 inches in diameter. Sale includes the Louis Vuitton coin purse pictured, its dust bag, box and priority shipping with tracking and signature confirmation. I accept Paypal and would like payment at sale end. Your item will be shipped within one business day of payment and you'll receive it in 2-3 business days. Shipping is within the U.S. only. If you have any questions, please ask and thanks for looking.",
