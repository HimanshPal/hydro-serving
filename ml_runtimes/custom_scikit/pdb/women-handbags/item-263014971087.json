  "Description": "Thank you for visiting our ebay store! My original painting \"Pensive Panda\". I use a process called all over photo realism to take my original paintings and make them into wearable art. All of our accessories come with our custom hang-tag that tells our story. Our Company Salvador Kitti, LLC was founded in the spring of 2010 by Atlanta artist Amy Pugh-Campos. The real Salvador was born in her art studio. Salvador crawled in her lap as she worked and put his paws in the paint. Amy and Salvador's love of painting inspired her to start a line of animal friendly gifts, accessories, and clothing. Amy uses images of her original works in a dynamic range of products. Our tag line is \"Eat, Paint, Meow\". That is what we do best. We also care deeply about the environment and our surroundings. We are a green company that is family-owned and operated. We only print on recycled paper. We have three passions in life: art, animals, and the environment. Giving Back Program A portion of all proceeds will go to wildlife conservation projects supported by Loggerhead Marine life Center, Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge, White Oak Conservation Center, and Zoo Atlanta. We also give product donations to the Gentle Barn and other non-profits as well as support Angels Among Pet Rescue Artist Bio Amy Pugh-Campos was born in Atlanta, GA. She began her career in art early on. She was sketching her stuffed animals before she could talk. She followed her gift all through high school and on the first day of class at Georgia State University, she learned of the unexpected death her father. She took this time to explore all avenues of artful expression and fell in love with the free spirit of art. She chose to avoid the conventional ways of studying art and approached her gifts on her own terms. These heart felt emotions, coupled with an innate curiosity of animals, has created the artist she is today - Double Sided Print \u00e2\u2014\u008f Microfiber \u00e2\u2014\u008f - foam padding \u00e2\u2014\u008f zip top closer \u00e2\u2014\u008f silver-tone heart shaped zipper pull \u00e2\u2014\u008f polyester lining \u00e2\u2014\u008f - Please see change purse, wrislet and cosmetic bag for details - american artist, nature, water resistant - animal print, giant panda Bear Gift Set- Coin Purse, Wristlet and Cosmetic Bag - From My Original Gift Set",
