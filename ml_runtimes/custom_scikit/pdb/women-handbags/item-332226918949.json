Each bag has a unique antique leather / lightly distressed vintage leather look. Parts from several hides may be used to make a single leather bag. So there may be some variation in color and the textures to the different parts of a bag, which will create a wonderfully unique effect. Because of different craftsman and there may be small differences in the style, construction to the bags shown on the website. The lining may be a lighter or darker colour to the one shown in the images. Please write to us to know the current stock color. Genuine leather might have very small cut / scars / mark on it, this does not mean it is damaged. There may also be visible creases in the leather. These features go to show the genuine origin of our leather satchels and messengers bags, they form part of the bag and not affect its durability. Pure leather may smell a little when it is fresh but smell will go away with uses. Please keep it in sun light and fresh air for some days.
