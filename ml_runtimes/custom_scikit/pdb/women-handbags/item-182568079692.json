  "ConditionDescription": "Good Used Condition. Both the purse and wallet are in good shape but do have wear from use. The material exhibits some wear/age but has no major stains, tears or snags. The wallet shows some dust/dirt particles on the interior near the credit card holder sections especially. The coin purse section is nice shape and was less used. The purse similarly shows some dust/dirt particles on the interior lining - especially at the bottom of the bag inside and in the pockets where items were once held. The front pockets also have the same little type of wear towards the very bottom - natural with use. Again the purse does not have any other major stains, tears or snags outside of this.",
