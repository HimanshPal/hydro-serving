  "Description": "Oakley Bathroom Sink The Oakley Bathroom Sink is a scaled-down version of its big brother, the Kitchen Sink. Despite this, it&39s still loaded with convenience features. The side zipper lets you access a padded sleeve that fits most tablets and e-readers, as well as some 13-inch laptop models. An organizer panel puts a muzzle on life&39s chaos, and the pack&39s lid has a dedicated pocket for your media player, complete with soft-brushed lining and a port for your headphone cable. No sense digging like a mole when you need something, so we included plenty of exterior pocket space. The outside is also rigged with D-ring and hook tie-downs, rings for attaching things, and aggressive styling that makes ordinary backpacks look like they should have sewn-on kitties. Padded laptop panel with side access fits some 13\" computers and most tablet / e-reader sized device, Organizer panel, Brushed media pocket on lid with headphone port, Padded back panel and shoulder straps, Heavy-duty polyester fabric with rubber bottom, 11\" Padded Laptop Sleeve Size 11.75\"x7\"x17\" Gender Men Color Black Thankyou for shopping with LuggagBase!
