  "Description": "I have listed this item as preowned but really is more like new. Tried it on the bag...do not need. A little scuffing which I have shown on the last photo . \u00a0What are find! A strap to meet all of your needs for your Dooney and Bourke handbags ! This strap is in three different pieces which allows such versatility. It can be used with only two pieces and would give you at the shortest hole a 19 inch long strap Using the three pieces at its longest it is 50 inches long . So this can be used as a shoulder strap or a Crossbody strap I guarantee that this is an authentic Dooney and Bourke strap. This is rich warm brown leather and the hardware is gold tone. This is a clip on strap and the hooks offer an additional couple inches.. Before purchasing please make sure the length is going to work for you as a shoulder or Crossbody Length. The leather on this seems to be a little wider and a little thicker than most of their straps that they have been making lately. See picture for width of strap. Measurements are approximate. Item will be shipped priority mail , tracked and insured. Check out my Dooney and Bourke handbags that I have listed and I always combine shipping and handling. Thank you for viewing.",
