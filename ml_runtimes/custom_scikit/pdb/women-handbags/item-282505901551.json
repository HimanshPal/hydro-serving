About Us Long before its inception in 2004, Patina believed in the preservation of luxury accessories and has strongly advocated against counterfeit merchandise being sold in the United States and the rest of the world. Because of the multitude of counterfeit items being sold on and offline, the founders of Patina created consignment services offerings to help promote authentic pre-owned premier handbags in a fierce online selling environment where counterfeit sellers are equipped with more tools and resources to outshine even legitimate sellers of authentic handbags. Most of our items are previously used, and the condition is described in each listing above the bulleted portion of the item's attributes description (last complete paragraph preceding bulleted list in each listing). Boutique Patina is not affiliated with any of these brands or companies, but we sell items purchased from these companies at a previous time, whether it be items purchased directly from branded boutiques or from a department store. We are selective - Patina Consignments is committed to carefully and professionally curating one of the most desirable collection of authentic pre-owned Chanel and Hermes handbags in the United States. Through brand zeal, established reputation, product expertise and an experienced history in selling only pre-owned authentic Chanel, Hermes sand other luxury pieces, Patina will deliver for its customers high quality service, convenience and assurance that their items are being traded for the best value possible in the current marketplace, while offering sellers lower fees than typical consignment or pawn shops with less specialized product knowledge. We look forward to helping you find another home for your luxury items. For inquiries, call or text 714-988-3415 Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.",
