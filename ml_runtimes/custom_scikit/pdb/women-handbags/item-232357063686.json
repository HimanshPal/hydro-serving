  "Description": "I guarantee you won't find another one like this anytime soon! This bag dates from the mid-late 1970's and was bought new by my parents at the Gucci flagship store in Rome, Italy. I actually used this bag for sleepovers as a kid... It has been tucked away in storage since about 1982. It's time someone used it--ready to go to a loving home!!! As stated above, it is by Gucci. It is a large tennis bag with a double pull zipper at the top, a large roomy interior, two large inner pockets and one spacious outer side zippered pocket with a gold \"GG\" logo pull. There is a large slim side pocket that holds a tennis racket or two (shown in photos). Wide (1 1/2 inches) sturdy straps with the trademark red and green wool stripes. Around the perimeter of the bag is a red/green twist decoration with a center horse bit/abstract double G design. In the interest of full disclosure, there are some cosmetic defects worth mentioning: Some of the twist design has come off from wear; there is some soiling on the white straps (I have not scrubbed them--probably would come clean with some oxygen cleaner or mild detergent and a soft brush); there is a yellowed rectangular area at the top of one of the sides (photo #8) where an adhesive sticker had been; minor tearing at the opening of the racket pocket (photo #10); minor tearing at one of the strap attachment (photo #11); an angled cut (clean cut--could be patched from the inside) on one of the sides (photo #12). For the most part, the white is very bright and in good condition, a testament to its fine quality after all these years. Measures 22 inches long, 15 inches high, and 6 inches wide (when packed). Straps measure 7 inches from top of bag edge to the top of the strap curve (could be used over the shoulder). Very useful piece of luggage since it is expands or can be relatively flat to carry. You don't even have to play tennis to own this beauty--a great carry on bag for a weekend away! Surprise someone very special--or maybe treat yourself! No one else will have one like it!!! Game, set, match!!! Shipping to any US destination is free. Please feel free to email me for shipping rates to Canada or overseas. Payment is via PayPal. I expect payment within 7 days of auction's end. I normally try to ship within 24 hours of payment. Happy Bidding and Good Luck!",
