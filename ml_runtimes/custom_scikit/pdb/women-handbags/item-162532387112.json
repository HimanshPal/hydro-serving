  "Description": "VERA BRADLEY THREE PIECE LUGGAGE/TRAVEL SET This is a GORGEOUS luggage and travel set from Vera Bradley. It is in the RARE retired Black Walnut pattern. The set is in excellent condition and consists of the following: 22\" Rolling Carry-on, XL Miller, and a Wallet-on-a-String. The carry-on is in excellent condition and only shows minor wear on the \"bumper\" and wheels. The carry-on has only been used a couple of times. The carry-on comes with a lock (that hasn't been used) and a strap to attach the Miller (or any other bag) to your carry-on. The XL Miller and the Wallet are also in excellent condition, showing little to no wear. One curious thing about the Miller is that the pattern on one side of the bag is a little different color. Look at the pictures to see what I mean. Because the difference is on opposite sides of the bag it wouldn't be noticeable when carrying the bag, but just wanted you to be aware. Perhaps it is supposed to be this way? A manufacturing error? All these pieces are TSA approved. With these three pieces you would have everything you need to take a trip!! These are the specifics for each piece.
