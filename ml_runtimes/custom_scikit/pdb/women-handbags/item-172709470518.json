  "Description": "New with tags GORGEOUS Dooney and Bourke Florentine Satchel in WHITE with NATURAL trim and accents. It is not a bright white...more like a very light cream color. The leather is very soft and supple and the natural trim is like saddle leather and will develop a rich patina over time. The handbag measures a whopping 15 inches in length, 12 inches in height and 6.5 inches in width (all measures are approximate). The inside boasts one inside zip pocket, two additional inside pockets and a cell phone pocket. The double whip stitched handles have an approximate drop of 4.5 inches and there's an additional adjustable strap that measures 23 inches in length. The inside of the bag is lined in red fabric with beautiful green suede lining the upper part of the bag that gently drapes over time. There are also 4 brass feet on the bottom to help protect your investment. Original price was $378.00. This is truly a beautiful, well made handbag that will last you for many, many years....you will NOT be disappointed! Dust bag and registration card included. ***It should be noted that the leather is what I would consider to be \"pebbled\" but the pebbling and the leather itself is very soft. I believe it is from their Florentine collection...not all handbags from that collection have that smooth, traditional \"Florentine\" leather. The description was taken from the tag (see picture 7) and if you check out D&B's website they do have a handbag similar to mine (the Florentine Domed Buckle Satchel) and the leather is identical to that of my handbag (same color too). I wanted to make sure that I made that distinction since it was asked of me by another EBayer. Also, a small section of leather to the left of the D&B icon appears to be slightly \"smoother\" in its pebbling (see picture 4)... this is NOT the result of any sort of wear... it's just the natural grain of the leather and does not detract from its beauty. I'm sorry but I do not ship internationally at this time. All of my items are guaranteed authentic and come from a pet free and smoke free home so buy with confidence! PayPal only accepted and payment is expected within 3 days of buying item or winning auction. In order to insure safe delivery I will add signature confirmation at no additional cost to you! Thanks for looking!",
