  "Description": "Designs by Keri\u00ae No charge to customize! Choose light pink or hot pink deer real tree or the regular pink real tree! TO PERSONALIZE: EMAIL ME AFTER PURCHASE WITH DETAILS Want this fabric in another of my bags style or sizes? No problem just email me This Boutique extra classy bag is my 1-2-3 design This is a great size bag is really roomy. This bag is made with a light pink fabric full of deer among branches and trees. I have used a solid chocolate brown for the center and handles then added a bright pink grosgrain ribbon and two bows between the fabrics or you may want to choose another color. Best of all it has the outside pockets great for cell phones etc.! Add a name or initials to this bag to make it extra special at no extra charge. I have added the doe and buck in a heart shape and you could choose that and also add a name above it or you may just want the babies name or yours in the center! The dimensions are : 17\" across the top, 13\" high and 5 x 12\" wide bottom. The extra wide comfortable handles are 31\" long. I have used fleece between the fabrics for shape. You choose your closure. Zipper, magnetic snap, button and loop, velcro, ribbon or a cloth tie. Matching accessories available for purchase Choose a make-up bag, wallet, changing pad, pencil case, check book cover or change purse. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Most of my items are made after purchase so I can offer customizing such as handle length, your choice of closures and adding a monogram, initials or full name. I can still add name or initials to a completed bag no problem. So I will always be out just a bit in orders Each and every order is important and I will complete yours as quickly as possible. If you are concerned with time, be sure to email me prior to purchase. Also if you have a rush order for a baby shower etc. just email me prior to purchase to be sure I can hurry it out for you. My home is smoke free and I really love what I do. Any questions just email me, I am always here to answer your emails and help you design that special bag for any occasion. All my Bags are made one at a time. No two are exactly a like. All dimensions are approx. I pay special attention to detail and I reinforce all stress points. I use only the very best fabrics and fleece available. I am always searching for new ideas and creating new patterns to keep up with the hottest fashions. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- LEGAL NOTICE: Copyright \u00a9 2001 Designs by Keri LLC.
