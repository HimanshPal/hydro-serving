  "Description": "Visconti VT6 Vintage Tan Leather Business Case Briefcase Messenger Work Bag Brand: Visconti Collection: Vintage Style Number: VT6 Color: Vintage Tan MSRP: $209.99 Pockets: 4 interior slip, 3 interior zip, 5 card slots Vintage vegetable tan brown leather has that dark and sultry look about it. This Visconti product is made from the finest leather and has that wonderful new leather aroma. Leather items may have wrinkles, scars, scratches that are inherent characteristics and natural beauty of the hide. This is strong, high quality leather and with its smooth polished surface and distressed antique finish, there's no doubt that this briefcase has plenty of attitude. If you covet the look of old, comfortably worn-in leather you won't have to wait the years it takes for the look to develop naturally as the leather has been specially prepared so that it takes on that much coveted, vintage effect much more quickly. The surface is designed to scratch easily but these marks will gently blend in over time adding to the unique character of the bag. The long adjustable strap enables the bag to be worn either over-the-shoulder or hands-free across-the-body. Each product comes with its own Visconti dust bag. This is a big bag with good capacity and will comfortably accommodate A4 sized note books, files and document wallets. The long adjustable strap is made from leather topped hardwearing polyester and has a sliding rubber shoulder grip for comfort when carrying heavy loads. The interior of the bag is fully lined and the main flap is luxuriously lined with suede. There are plenty of compartments and pockets to organise contents.
