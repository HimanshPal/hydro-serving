  "Description": "Product Description: This sumptuous design is instantly recognisable as the work of the Decorative Arts revivalist William Morris. It reproduces in glorious detail an original tapestry created by Morris in the late 19th century. The picture of a thrush stealing young strawberries is said to have been inspired by the Morris family's attempts to grow the fruit at their Oxfordshire home of Kelmscott Manor. This design sets the scene against a blue background - it is also available in a version with a red background. This elegant handbag not only looks fashionably fantastic, but has also been designed for the busy lifestyle. Yes, we've all been there before, quickly fumbling around to find the elusive purse or car keys. This new design concept keeps to an original classic style but encompasses a full zip down, allowing you to open the bag very widely so you can quickly find the bags contents. Beautifully designed tapestry bags from Signare - 'As individual as you are'.",
