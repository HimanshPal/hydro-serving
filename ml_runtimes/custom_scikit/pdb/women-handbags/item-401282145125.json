Wow it has 6 inside pockets and 5 outside!

Matching accessories available. Choose a make-up bag, wallet, changing pad, pencil case, check book cover or change purse. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Most of my items are made after purchase so I can offer customizing such as handle length, your choice of closures and adding a monogram, initials or full name.
