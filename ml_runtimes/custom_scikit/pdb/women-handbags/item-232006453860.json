An ultra-soft, padded laptop compartment deftly protects and carries up to 18\" laptops while still leaving enough room in the main compartment for a gaming console and accessories.

A clever buckle system allows the compartment to open halfway for quick access or a full 180 degrees for easy loading.

Dual hip pockets provide extra storage and quick access to important items like keys, mobile phone, or a media player without taking the bag off. A zippered outer pocket and a quick-stash slot provide additional easy-access storage To keep your valuable contents protected in all weather conditions, the Beacon has an integrated stow-away water-resistant weather cover for use in sand, snow, rain, or dust. As with all Everki products, the Beacon is backed by Everki's Limited Lifetime Warranty and world-class customer service.",
