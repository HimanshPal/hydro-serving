  "Description": "Tignanello has always been the leather standard in Macy's department store. The first one I bought was a backpack model for $130 and I considered it a bargain. The leather is always soft and supple. The colors are vibrant. Here is Tignanello's multi-functional crossbody bag. Long adjustable strap so you can wear it over your shoulder or crossbody. This bag has several cool features for organizing all of your stuff:interior organizer pocket for six credit cardsinterior pocket for IDtwo interior pockets for cash/extra credit cards/receiptsmagnetic closure of the interior sectiontwo zippered larger sections for handbag stuffeasy turn clasp for keeping it all togetherlong crossbody strap that's adjustableheavy duty zippers and buckles so it will lastyellow leather in the color sunrise This bag retails for $119 and still has the tags attached. All of my items are smoke-free and pet-free and stored in odorless protective plastic containers. Since this is my new store I am only permitted to list 10 items per month, so please choose carefully. I can't do returns yet and I can't make special listings. I can modify listings so if you want more than one, message me before checking out. I offer combined shipping. Please message me BEFORE you purchase to ask the combined shipping price. I can't do anything to alter shipping once it's been purchased.",
