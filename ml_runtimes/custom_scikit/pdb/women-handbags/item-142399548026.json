  "Description": "The Piece This amazing quality piece of workmanship is hand carved throughout. The Jadeite is untreated and features a natural pale green and deep brown color. The piece depicts 3D carved tiger above a two up-side down flying bats, peanut, and ginseng plant. On the back, the carving continues with a third bat flying. Symbolism found in Chinese Culture The tiger (hu \u864e) is one of the twelve animals of the Chinese Zodiac and is considered the ruler of the beasts on Earth as opposed to the dragon which rules the beasts in the sky and heavens. The word for tiger (hu) is also a pun because it has the same pronunciation as the word \"protect\" (hu \u62a4). In ancient China, the tiger was the Guardian Spirit of Agriculture which could devour the Drought Demon.Tigers appear on amulets because they are powerful animals, symbolize heroism, and are believed to be able to eat evil spirits, or at least cause them to flee, and can in general protect people from misfortune.Tigers also are able to see well in the dark. For these reasons, images of tigers and tiger's heads are considered particularly effective in protecting children from malignant spirits.Tigers also symbolize longevity because the ancient Chinese believed tigers turned white after 500 years and could live for 1,000 years. Upon death, their spirits entered the earth and became amber. A picture of a bat (fu \u8760) can be a visual pun for \"good fortune\" or happiness (fu \u798f) because both characters are pronounced fu. Often the bat is shown flying upside down because the character (dao \u5012) for \"upside-down\" and the character (dao \u5230) meaning \"to have arrived\" are both pronounced dao. Therefore, if a person were to say \"the bat is flying upside down\" a listener could just as easily hear this as \"happiness has arrived\" which, of course, has a very auspicious connotation. Additionally, \"a bat descending from the sky\" (fuzi tianlai \u8760\u5b50\u5929\u6765) sounds exactly like \"happiness descends from heaven\" (fuzi tianlai \u798f\u5b50\u5929\u6765). Two bats facing each other mean double good fortune or happiness. A Chinese charm or coin with a square central hole is sometimes referred to as an \"eye coin\" (yanqian \u773c\u94b1). The Chinese word for coin or money (qian \u94b1) is pronounced the same as the word for \"before\" (qian \u524d). Therefore, a picture of a bat (fu \u8760) on (zai \u5728) an \"eye coin\" (yanqian \u773c\u94b1) creates a visual pun since saying there is a \"bat on the coin\" (fu zai yan qian) sounds exactly like saying \"happiness is before your eyes\" (fu zai yan qian \u798f\u5728\u773c\u524d). Chinese coins are a potent symbol of wealth and prosperity. The peanut (huasheng \u82b1\u751f) is an auspicious symbol because its second character (sheng \u751f) means to \"give birth\". The peanut thus symbolizes the wish for many children. The carving is extremely detailed and evident of Chinese craftsmen, specifically Stone cutters.The pendant measures just about 2 and 1/2\" tall by just under 1 and 1/2\" wide by 1/2\" thick. Comes with a 12\" long weaved strap connected by a jade ring. This piece can either be displayed on a wooden stand or worn as a pendant necklace or carried as a purse charm for good luck. Chinese Stone cutters were considered some of the finest artisans in the world during the Vintage Era. They would carved western themes as well as the more rare traditional eastern themes into their many pieces.It was in China\u2014where the gem-carving tradition was already thousands of years old\u2014that jadeite reached its peak as an important artistic medium. The first jadeite reached China in the late 1700's, and late eighteenth and early nineteenth century carvers created masterpieces that are still unsurpassed in concept, design, and technical execution. Antique and Vintage jewelry is disappearing at alarming rates. Unfortunately, most of the jewelry from this time period has been lost over the years, please don't miss your chance to own this special piece of history!
