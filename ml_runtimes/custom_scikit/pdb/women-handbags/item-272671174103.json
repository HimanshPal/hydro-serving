  "Description": "This diaper bag is in excellent condition. I received it as a shower gift but never used it. It does not have a changing pad. It can also be used as a lap top or overnight bag. The material is clean and odor free. It has many pockets and compartments to hold all the things a baby needs for a happy, successful outing. There is a long over the shoulder strap and two hand straps. The over the shoulder strap is adjustable so mom or dad can comfortably and safely hold baby while wearing the bag as a cross body. Several changes of clothes, toys, milk, diapers, snacks, baby wipes, your wallet, cell phone and car keys can all have a place to go and easily accessed. Perfect for a shower gift for that new mom who doesn't want to give up being stylish and on trend just because she had a baby.This collection of diaper bags originally sold at Coach for $499.Everything listed through bensbrowneyes has been carefully chosen to reflect our love of things that have historical significance, are aesthetically pleasing, have been hand crafted or are just interesting, cool and funky.
