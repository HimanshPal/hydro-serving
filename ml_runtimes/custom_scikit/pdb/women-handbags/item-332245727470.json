About Us About Us Payment Shipping Returns About Us Ann's Fabulous Finds was started nine years ago out of a love for exciting, well made, and fun designer accessories. Since then we have sold thousands of authentic designer goods through our on-line consignment shop. We are originally antique dealers who started collecting wonderful designer handbags, accessories, and jewelry we found along the way. We have many years experience buying and selling authentic designer goods. EVERY item we sell is guaranteed to be authentic! Payment Payment We accept credit cards through Paypal. You do not need a Paypal account to use Paypal. Payment must be received within 3 days of the close of auction. If payment isn't received within 3 days, the auction will be revoked and a Non-Paying Bidder alert will be filed. If an item is paid for after the 3 day payment period and the item has already been re-posted, payment will be refunded less eBay insertion, eBay final value and PayPal fees. Michigan residents will be charged 6% sales tax Shipping Shipping We ship using USPS and Fedex. Items that sell for more than $500 will be shipped to the United States for FREE! (Please wait for us to send you an invoice if the auction started below $500, but ends above $500.) Items that sell for less than $500 will be shipped to the United States for $15.00. Items will be shipped to Canada and the United Kingdom for a flat rate of $40.00(USD). For shipping to other countries please contact us, before bidding, for details and availability. ALL items will be shipped with insurance for their full auction sale price. International shipments cannot be marked as gifts and the value declared for customs will be the auction sale price. We do not ship to PO Boxes. The shipping cost given includes the handling fee, which is $5 unless otherwise noted. We will combine shipping for multiple auctions. Oversized Item Shipping: The flat rate shipping rate does not apply to oversized items. Shipping charges will be determined for oversized items once their destination has been determined. Please refer to item description for any special shipping information. Returns Returns If you are unhappy with your purchase, the item can be returned for a refund for 14 days after receipt of payment. Please contact us for pre-approval on all returns. You are responsible for all return shipping charges. We will give you a full refund, minus all shipping charges incurred by AFF. Please contact us if you have any questions.
