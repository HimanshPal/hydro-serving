  "Description": "Designs by Keri\u00ae No charge to customize! TO PERSONALIZE: EMAIL ME WITH DETAILS AFTER PURCHASE Want a name or initials? No charge Choose from the solid back ground or the plaid This is not a licensed John Deere product. It is however, hand-crafted from licensed John Deere fabric. I am not affiliated with or sponsored by Springs Creative Products Group, LLC. Wow this XLG bag has 6 inside pockets and 4 outside! Great for the travel and just every day to carry so many things all neatly! This large bag is made with a two toned brown plaid and has large John Deere equipment in green with emblems and I used a solid chocolate brown to coordinate. This bag has two flat pockets outside both front and back great to fit all kinds of things in and still tons of room inside! I added a thick yellow grosgrain ribbon with a green grosgrain ribbon running through the center to stand out. The aprox dimensions are: 19\" across the top of the bag, 14\" tall and it has a 5\" wide bottom. The comfortable handles are 31\" long. The bag is fully lined and there are 6 interior pockets with pretty embroidered tops which are perfect for bottles, sunglasses, cellphones, wallets, etc. It has a heavy fleece lining for stability and stands on it's own even when empty. You choose your closure, zipper, magnetic snap, button and loop or velcro. This is a perfect bag for anyone who loves room for everything! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Matching accessories available Choose a make-up bag, wallet, changing pad, pencil case, check book cover or change purse. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Most of my items are made after purchase so I can offer customizing such as handle length, your choice of closures and adding a monogram, initials or full name. I can still add name or initials to a completed bag no problem. So I will always be out just a bit in orders Each and every order is important and I will complete yours as quickly as possible.
