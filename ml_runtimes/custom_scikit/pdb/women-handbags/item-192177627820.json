DISCLAIMER: I obtain all the items that I list on eBay from many different sources, including discount centers, outlet stores, close-out sales, resale shops, auctions, garage sales, and even from eBay. While I always try to do my best to describe each item and its condition, it is possible that occasionally I may miss something. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. I stand behind my listings and will do my best to make amends for any mistakes (see my Return Policy below). I would not sell anything that I personally would not use myself. While I myself do not smoke, I cannot always guarantee the items come from a smoke free environment (even some of my new with tags items). Because of this I DO NOT list as \"Smoke Free\" or \"Pet Free\". If smoke is a real issue with you, or if you have pet allergies, please do not bid or buy. Or, at least please ask questions before buying. Thank you. Do You Want more Vera Bradley Vera items? Then you might want to check out my other listings. At this time I also have the Vera Bradley Trimmed Vera Traveler in the solid colors Classic Black and Magenta, and in the Vera Bradley signature patterns Heather and Midnight Paisley. Plus I have several other style Vera Bradley purses, totes, backpacks, and travel bags available in many different color patterns. All are New, with Tags. Having a hard time deciding on a color. With my low starting bids and discounted Buy-it-Now prices, why not buy more than one. And, to save you even more money, I am always willing to combine shipping (see below). Shipping & Handling Discounts Available. Check out all the other great items I have listed on eBay. To save you money, I will be happy to combine Shipping & Handling Charges for multiple auctions. If you intend to bid on any of my auction, just let me know, and also when your buying is complete. At that time, I will send you a revised invoice that reflects discounted shipping & handling charges. Sometimes eBay's combined shipping discount calculator does not correctly calculate the correct weight of the combine packages, resulting in an inflated shipping rate. In those cases I will reissue a corrected invoice. Please wait for me to sent the revised invoice with the corrected shipping charges. If you do pay the invoice with the higher shipping price, I will refund the difference to your Pay Pal account. Feel free to contact me using eBay\u2019s message system if you have any questions, or for exact combined shipping charges. Be sure to include your Zip Code and the items you want to buy or will be bidding on. Payment Policy: Payment is due within 10 days of auction closing. I will issue a revised invoice when combining shipping on two or more of my auctions. Simply inform me when buying is complete by using eBay\u2019s Request Total Option. Due to eBay\u2019s policy payment must be processed thought PayPal. Shipping Policy: I will Ship your Item(s) within one (1) business day (sometimes same day) of receiving your CLEARED Payment. E-Checks can take up to 4 business days to clear. Your item(s) will ship USPS Priority Mail (normal delivery time 2-3 Business days) or USPS Standard Mail (3-10 business days), your choice. If your package weights less that 13oz I will also offer 1st Class Mail as a less expensive alternative. Please note that in order to serve you best I offer more than one shipping method for you to choose from. Shipping charges, when applicable, are calculated on total package weight, sometimes less (I pay the difference), never any Handling Fees. And remember, I am always more than happy to combine shipping to save you money. Also, think \u201cGreen\u201d. I am very ecology minded. I reuse boxes and bubble envelopes, or fashion shipping containers from used cardboard whenever possible. SAVE THE PLANET! Every little bit helps. Return Policy Details: Item can be returned for Full Refund, less Shipping Costs, within 7 business days. If item is not as described I will issue a full refund, including the Shipping & Handling Charges I bill for. Buyer is responsible for return shipping costs. Refunds will be issued through PayPal after I have received the returned item. Should you want to return an item for any reason, PLEASE contact me directly, using the eBay Message System, rather than opening a Return Request through eBay.
