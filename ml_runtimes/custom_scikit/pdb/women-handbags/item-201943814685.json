  "Description": "Temporary price cut! This is a $300 bag, reduced now to only $129!!! Until supplies last, which they won't! Don't miss this deal! Best price. Best bag on eBay! \u2028**ATTENTION! THIS BAG IS DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS LISTED ON EBAY! It is the ONLY bag with the LARGE, spacious interior pockets, not the impractical tiny ones that hold only a cell phone! (See photo #5) You will be glad you have the storage space! 4 large inner pockets, plus a zipper pouch! Zip top closure & magnetic outside pocket closure. THE HOLY GRAIL OF DIAPER BAGS! The ever so popular Eliz-a-Baby diaper bag from Marc by Marc Jacobs. But this bag has the extra STORAGE space you will need! This is a fashion statement, not a blah diaper bag! SPACIOUS, GORGEOUS, & AMAZING! You will never use another diaper bag again! Sheek & fashionable design! Very high quality, nylon & cotton, lots of compartments & storage, large capacity, and perfectly designed for the busy mommy :) \u2028THIS BAG IS SOLD OUT EVERYWHERE! RETAIL ON THIS BAG IS $300 PLUS+tax! Save big money HERE! -Color- Black -Extra large capacity: Measurements: 17\"H x 13.5\"H x 6\"D. Approx. 8\" handle drop. -Crossbody strap: Approx. 12\"-23\" -Changing pad: Approx. 22.5\"L x 12.5\"W *NOTE: I have been asked a lot & this is important! This is the bag with 2 LARGE, deep inner pockets to fit diapers etc. etc. + 2 interior side pockets for bottles etc. They don't make these anymore! The new version has tiny pockets only large enough to fit cell phones! NOT DIAPERS! Not sure why MJ switched to those but they are impractical & have virtually no storage space. You'll be SO glad you got the original, spacious bag made to fit all your baby's necessities. Don't spend the same price on a used or display model missing the changing pad etc. This bag is brand new, never used, & with tags. Original shoulder strap, portable changing pad & dust bag are included! THIS IS THE COMPLETE PACKAGE! *Bottle/baby items are used for scale, not included in purchase ~FAST, SAME DAY SHIPPING :)",
