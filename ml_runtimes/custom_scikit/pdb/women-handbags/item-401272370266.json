  "Description": "Designs by Keri\u00ae No charge to customize! TO PERSONALIZE: EMAIL ME AFTER PURCHASE WITH DETAILS Add cowgirl embroidery designs or a name or cute saying at the top to personalize it at no extra charge. Dimensions are aprox: xlg 14\" tall x 19\" wide x 5\" deep with 31\" handles This is a great size bag really roomy. This bag is made with a red bandana and cowgirl print. Wow it has 4 large outside pockets and the six inside with pretty embroidered tops. I have used fleece between the fabrics for shape and the tote stand's on it's own even when empty. You choose your closure. Zipper, magnetic snap, button and loop, Velcro, ribbon or a cloth tie. Matching accessories available in the pink bandana upon purchase. Choose a make-up bag, wallet, changing pad, pencil case, check book cover or change purse. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Most of my items are made after purchase so I can offer customizing such as handle length, your choice of closures and adding a monogram, initials or full name. I can still add name or initials to a completed bag no problem. So I will always be out just a bit in orders Each and every order is important and I will complete yours as quickly as possible. If you are concerned with time, be sure to email me prior to purchase. Also if you have a rush order for a baby shower etc. just email me prior to purchase to be sure I can hurry it out for you. My home is smoke free and I really love what I do. Any questions just email me, I am always here to answer your emails and help you design that special bag for any occasion. All my Bags are made one at a time. No two are exactly a like. All dimensions are approx. I pay special attention to detail and I reinforce all stress points. I use only the very best fabrics and fleece available. I am always searching for new ideas and creating new patterns to keep up with the hottest fashions. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- LEGAL NOTICE: Copyright \u00a9 2001 Designs by Keri LLC.
