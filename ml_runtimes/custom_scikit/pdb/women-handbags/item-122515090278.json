Questions about the item regarding size, color, fabrication, etc. are to be made prior to purchase if buyer is unsure regarding any of these variables. We are here to assist you prior to purchase regarding any of our items to decrease likelihood of a future return. Please ask before you buy and please visit the manufacturer\u2019s websites for additional product brand and sizing information. Returns must be requested via eBay Messaging. Once the return is approved by the seller, buyers are responsible for paying return shipping, and the seller will subtract their initial shipping fee, including shipping confirmation and packaging costs from the amount of the purchase price. Once the item is received back in original packaging, with tags attached and showing no signs of wear to include but not be limited to: item being stretched out or damaged as a result of attempting to fit into an undersized item, item having noticeable odor, pet hair, stains, etc., buyer will be asked to cancel the sale prior to refund.

International Return Policy: We do not offer returns on international sales and shipments. No exceptions. Shipping General/Other: Items usually ship within one business day of purchase unless otherwise stated or if purchase falls on a postal holiday or on a weekend. If seller indicates via their Store Vacation Settings which also shows on each listing that they are on vacation, then any items purchased while seller is away will ship out upon seller\u2019s return. Items will ship to eBay or PayPal confirmed addresses only. Please be sure your eBay and PayPal shipping addresses are the same as shipment may be facilitated out of either entity. Combined shipping rates may be requested prior to purchase. Request combined shipping rates via eBay Messaging service prior to purchase. Our shipping fees take into account postage, confirmation when applicable, packaging material and time, and transport to the post office or shipper\u2019s facility. As happens infrequently, if an item sells out of our physical inventory before we end our eBay listing for that item, and an eBay purchase is made for that item no longer in stock, the buyer will be notified to cancel the sale for full refund and also offered any item in our store for a 10% discount. Free Domestic Shipping USA: Items offered to be shipped free of charge will ship out via USPS First Class Mail in most cases. Decision as to shipping method is up to seller. All other general shipping rules and return policies apply. Priority or Expedited Shipping USA: Expedited Shipping is available. By selecting Expedited Shipping, buyer agrees to additional shipping fee, terms and conditions. All general shipping rules and return policies apply. International Shipping (Outside USA): We ship world-wide. Items offered for sale internationally are subject to the following conditions: International sales are final. No returns, no exceptions. By purchasing this item, the buyer agrees to the shipping cost and terms of sale. If you are making this purchase as an international buyer, you agree not to provide negative feedback in regard to item shipping costs or length of time it takes to receive an item. It is very likely that although the postal service suggests it will take between 5-10 business days for an international shipment to arrive, this delivery time can and very likely may be delayed, particularly if the package is opened for inspection, or if it is shipped during a busy holiday season, during a postal strike or unforeseen circumstance. In some cases it can take a month or more for an international item to reach its destination. The seller will ship out international packages usually within one business day of purchase as noted above in the Shipping General section. The seller is not responsible, nor may the buyer hold the seller accountable for delays in the postal system. International shipments are sent via USPS International First Class Mail unless the buyer requests, prior to purchase, a quote for International Priority or International Express Mail. These services will be significantly higher that USPS First Class Mail International, but may be tracked. Seller is responsible for packaging and shipping item to buyer, and providing Customs Claim Form number. For regular International First Class Mail Shipments, there is no guarantee of delivery. However, the buyer will receive a Customs Claim Form number in the tracking section of the sale after purchase for proof of shipment. The seller cannot track International First Class Mail packages after shipment. Thus, the buyer is accountable and assumes complete responsibility for using the Customs Claim Form number to track any package not received or not received in what they deem a timely manner. US and International laws prohibit the seller from marking merchandise values below item cost or to mark items as a gift. International shipping fees are as listed unless shipping cost is determined to be significantly more expensive than shipping cost stated, which may happen on rare occasion due to unexpected postal rate hikes or excessive weight incurred in secure packaging. In such a case, we will contact buyer to determine whether they want to cancel the sale or agree to pay difference in shipping cost. All import duties, taxes and fees are the sole responsibility of the buyer. Please contact your local customs office prior to purchase if you have questions about customs fees. International items are insured and the buyer agrees to fill out and sign any shipping insurance claim form(s) and return to seller promptly upon loss or damage of item. Any fraudulent claims will hold the buyer liable for any prosecution for mail fraud under the federal crime code. By purchasing this item as an international customer you agree to the above terms without exception. Payment: We accept PayPal. Auction items paid for within 24 hours are guaranteed to be shipped in one business day of payment receipt. Buyers who pay after the 24-hour window are not guaranteed one-day shipping. Due to issues with a few buyers who have abused our return policy, threatened negative feedback, and who have also abused eBay\u2019s Buyer Protection Policy which does not allow for buyer\u2019s remorse, purchasing an incorrect size, change of mind, etc., we have implemented the revised Terms and Conditions. Again, these policies allow for added protection for the reputable buyer and advance warning to those buyers who attempt to use feedback extortion or other fraudulent activity against our business. Moving forward, such buyers will be reported to eBay and blocked from further purchase of our products. Thank you for understanding and adhering to the Terms and Conditions of Sale as listed. We appreciate your continued support of our business. Thank you for visiting our store. Please contact us anytime with questions. Sincerely, the crew at A Bag of Mixed Gear!
