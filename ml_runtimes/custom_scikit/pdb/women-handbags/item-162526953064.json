  "Description": "Showstopper Small Briefcase Satchel Handbag Can hold small Documents & Objects Beautiful item which has been used no more than 3 times Has a lock on it - tiny key case is attached to bag and can be removed If you have to step out of a meeting and leave your bag you can lock it Makes a very \"executive woman\" statement when carried - it is both beautiful and practical Gold hardware in excellent condition Very interesting pattern in Leather Dark burgundy in color with a red interior THIS IS A MAJOR BARGAIN AS THE BAG WAS CLOSE TO $2,000 new Prada label and ID cards RETURN POLICY NO RETURNS except for items damaged in shipping or items which are significantly different from the description. Photographs are an important part of the description so study them carefully. All items, new or used, may, at times, have a tiny flaw if you look closely enough. I describe items as accurately as I can, pointing out anything I see as a flaw but on occasion, I may miss something small. This is not a reason for calling an item \"not as described\". Not liking the way an item of clothing looks on you is not an acceptable reason for return. \"Doesn't fit\" is also NOT a reason for return; that's why we stress the need to measure a similar garment to ensure fit. COLOR: Another issue could be that of the item\u2019s color. One person\u2019s \"gold\" may be another person\u2019s \"yellow\" so don\u2019t rely on the words alone \u2013 ask specific questions, and study the photographs. Also, the photo does not always reflect the exact color of the item. The color you see depends on the camera, the lighting and your computer monitor. If the photo does not reflect the color accurately I mention this in the description, but again, please ask questions. SIZES: With clothing and shoes, if you have not measured an item of yours to compare with my measurements and the item does not fit, this is not a reason for return. Do not go by the marked size alone as some used items may have been taken in or let out and all designers have different ways of sizing CONDITION: Please do not expect absolute perfection in vintage items as they will all show some signs of wear. Please look at my definitions for vintage: Excellent \u2013 I have checked the item carefully and found no obvious flaws. If applied to vintage it may show tiny signs of wear that have no effect on the beauty of the piece. Again ask questions. Very Good \u2013 Means there may be a few small but practically unnoticeable flaws. No items will be listed that are not in new, excellent or very good condition except pieces that are listed as repair pieces SHIPPING COSTS We always pack items to ensure their safety. We do not have any handling charges, only actual shipping costs. In the US we use USPS priority mail. For international mail if the item is under 4 lbs, we use USPS first class international mail \u2013 if it is more than 4 lbs we use USPS International priority mail. If you need special arrangements please discuss with us. INTERNATIONAL BUYERS: Import duties, taxes, and charges are not included in the item price or shipping cost. These charges are the buyer's responsibility. Please check with your country's Customs office to determine what these additional costs will be prior to bidding or buying. Customs fees are normally charged by the shipping company or collected when you pick the item up. These fees are not additional shipping charges. Arrival time for international items greatly depends on the destination country\u2019s Customs procedures. Items may arrive in a week or as long as 3 to 4 weeks. We have absolutely no control over postal costs and time of delivery. Thanks for your patience. Payment Instructions: We welcome international buyers but you must pay by PayPal with a credit card or direct deposit. Payments must be made within 72 hours of auction end.",
