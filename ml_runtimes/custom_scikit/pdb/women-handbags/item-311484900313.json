CEO, Linda Lightman, a former lawyer, began selling her son\u2019s video games on eBay over fourteen years ago, and after learning the ropes of the process she put her own designer clothes up for auction. It wasn\u2019t long before she was selling other people\u2019s unwanted clothing, shoes, handbags, accessories and jewelry. What began as a hobby developed into an entrepreneurship and a highly successful business. Along with her husband, Linda runs Linda\u2019s Stuff Inc. and now employs over a hundred employees in multiple departments. The company recently relocated to a larger facility and calls Hatboro, Pennsylvania home.
