  "Description": "Authentic MZ WALLACE \"Willow\" tote in beautiful Sparkle Linen color....so neutral & versatile. MSRP $395. This would not only make a great work or pleasure tote, but also great for the gym & beach! Great condition as I didn't carry this bag all that much (just a handful of times during summer season since i purchased it from MZW website). There are just 2 small things to note. There's a small ink mark inside the bag that I'm pointing to in a picture. It could probably be removed. There's also a very tiny mark that I'm showing in 1 picture, that is towards bottom of bag. It almost looks like it could be part of the actual coated linen material, but I'm not sure. It does not detract from the beauty of the bag but I need to mention it. This bag is not new/pristine but it has a TON of life left in it & is in GREAT condition overall. Comes with tags, zeros copy of my receipt (with my personal info blacked out), MZW dustcover, the plastic bag from shipping & all shown within my pics. The following is the official description from MZ Wallace on this \"Willow\" tote ~ Willow is a slouchy shoulder bag with thin handles and a cross-body strap option.
