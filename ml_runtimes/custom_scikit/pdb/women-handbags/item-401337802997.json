These charges are the buyer's responsibility. These are normally charged by the shipping company or collected when you pick the item up. Please check with your country's customs office to determine what these additional costs will be prior to bidding or buying. Some items may not be able to be shipped to your particular country due to size or restrictions placed on certain products by your country. If the shipping calculator doesn't give you an option, then we are unable to ship this item to you. We won't undervalue merchandise or mark the item as a gift on customs forms.
