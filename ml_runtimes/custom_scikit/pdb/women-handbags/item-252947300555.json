Feedback is given after receiving buyer's.\u00a0 If there is a problem please contact me before leaving feedback; I will work with you to resolve ANY issue. 5 star feedback is most appreciated! About me: Selling on eBay has given me a new passion for life! I worked as an RN for\u00a0 40 + years ( a LONG time),until an accident in 2008 ended that career. I was hit by a truck bike riding in Northern Michigan on the Fourth of July. The bike and I went completely under the truck and the injuries were major;. 6 weeks in ICU, many surgeries, ventilator, infections to treat, you get the picture! Then a 5 hour ambulance ride to our local hospital for 6 more weeks in rehab. Many months in a wheel chair before I could walk again, outpatient rehab including treatment for the closed head injury I sustained. And more surgeries. Meanwhile, I finally had to turn in my badge and nursing bag ( I was a home care RN ... They did keep my space for nearly a year.) IN 2011 I decided to try selling on eBay with the help and encouragement of my family. First I needed a computer and printer and had to learn how to USE\u00a0 them. \u00a0 It was a HUGE learning curve for me and I gave up several times before I finally \"got it\"! I started with odds and ends around the house. Then came Vera Bradley, a product I've been loving and buying for years! ( I still love my \" Chanticleer \" Miller bag and MANY others. )\u00a0 It has become my new job.\u00a0 I'm once again productive and working at something to both enjoy and earn a little cash. it keeps my brain working and drives me from being idle! ( I try not to make mistakes but that has been known to happen... ) \u00a0 I buy the things I love, keep a lot and sell most! I buy only authentic products from reliable sources.\u00a0 I watch the sales, buy in bulk sometimes and always from USA sources. \u00a0 I sell mostly new and a few preowned vintage pieces I find along the way. Recently I've branched out to selling a few other items. I keep my prices low to give you the buyer the best deal I can.\u00a0 I will \"personal shop\" for you if you can't find your favorite pattern and style! \u00a0 The most recent challenge I've faced is a diagnosis of breast cancer ( Jan, 23, 2017). Surgery over and hopefully can continue this new reason to work! Your positive feedback will be most appreciated after you find you're satisfied with your purchase. \u00a0 Please save me in \"your favorites\" Thanks!",
