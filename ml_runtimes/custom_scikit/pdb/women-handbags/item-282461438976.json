Get uber organized on the go with the Lug quilted Puddle Jumper 2.0 gym/overnight bag. Fashion meets real function thanks to convenient carrying options and plenty of pockets--both inside and out. Thought-of-everything touches include a handy removable pouch, hidden magnetic pocket, and detachable mirror. Not too big and not too small, with a pocket or pouch for every last thing, it's easy to see why this bag is a best seller. With so many great features, it's hard to pick a favorite: Probably the clear-coated bottom for easy cleaning and durability. Or the travel strap that attaches to any standard rolling luggage handle. Or the ventilated compartment that keeps the dirty clothes/shoes away from the clean. Or the - you get the picture. This bag has all the bells and whistles. The Puddle Jumper design was inspired by frustration of having to topple over and squish larger duffel bags to fit into a gym locker. The bag was specifically designed to fit upright for easy in and out access!",
