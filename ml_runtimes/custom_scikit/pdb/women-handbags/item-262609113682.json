As mother of four, you can rest assured she knows exactly what she wants when it comes to diaper bags\u2026 \u201cI have 4 children. (6, 4, 2, and 3 months) One of which is special needs so I have to pack three kids worth of stuff in a diaper bag. This diaper bag allows that to happen with a large space to pack stuff :) I can pack two outfits for all three children and diapers for them as well!! And I still have room, I can fit two juice cups in one side pocket (which it has two side pockets) I also got the product exactly when it was said to be delivered.\u201dDiane from Florida\u00a0can\u2019t wait to be out of the diaper stage, but she\u2019s not giving up her Hip Cub bag! \u201cSo perfect. There is a place for everything, just love it. It replaces my old one which just didn't have enough space/pockets etc. This will be used even after diaper stage. Couldn't be happier.\u201dTake\u00a0Cassie\u2019s\u00a0word for it: this it-bag is a must-have! \u201cThis is such a cute bag! I was really excited to find this one! One of my friends shared it and I am SUPER happy she did. This bag is so stylish and pretty much goes with everything. Not only that but it is HUGE! Based on the pictures I thought it was going to be smaller but I'm glad I was wrong. I love the pockets on the inside and the outside. (Again, super big) for quick and easy stuffing for the on the go mom. All around the bag is a great quality and super durable. Love, love, love it! Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a cute, durable and useful diaper bag.\u201d Click to edit textClick to edit text",
