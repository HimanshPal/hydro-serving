  "Description": "DIDN'T GET WHAT YOU WANT? LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NEW? Looking for something for yourself or a gift? Check Here!For Sale New but without tags Briefcase/Laptop Tote made of Leather.This tote came from Franklin Covey retail store. I purchased this for myself several years ago.I had the intent of using it for school to take my laptop and text books for classes but never did. I finally took it out of the package and than decided to never use it. Unfortunately it has been collecting dust ever since. It is beautiful with black leather and a black liner. Comes with straps for hand or over shoulder carrying. The front (pictured first) has a small outer pocket which would be great for keys or a cell phone or both. The back side not pictured does not have an outer pocket.The inside has 3 compartments for storage1st compartment has a zipper pocket sort of what you would find in a purse2nd compartment is the middle which is where the laptop probably goes and can zip up 3rd compartment has several pockets on sidewall for things and a snap and key ring for keys to be stored for easy convenience. Great for work keys that you would want to keep separate.This bag retailed for over $160+ why I never used it? I cant remember. I now have another bag I use and love, so this wont work for meWhile cleaning out some files in my file cabinet, I found a print out from when I was looking at this onlineHere is what it says for the product details:\"You can carry up to legal-size files, a binder and your laptop protected in its padded compartment.
