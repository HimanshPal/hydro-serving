  "ConditionDescription": "This briefcase is in good, presentable pre-owned condition with some light signs of age and wear. The caviar leather exterior shows some normal signs of gentle age and light wear. This can be easily polished and shined to look excellent by any shoe smith. There are some areas of distress on the interior flex-fold area edges one is around 1.5\" and the other is very minor These areas of wear can likely be mended and improved by a shoe smith. The gold hinge hardware by the carry handle still have a very nice golden shine. The locking latch shows some light scratches but still looks petty good. The interior is in good condition. Please thoroughly review the photos and enlarge them to show detail.",
