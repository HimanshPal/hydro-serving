  "Description": "This Alexander McQueen Clover Medium Satchel is a perfect example of a good use, of Patient Leather and Gold Hardware. A fantastic Statement Piece! With its Over the Top Twist Toggle closure, and Golden Top Zipper you will smile as you retrieve your things inside. Inside you will find a Single black zipper pocket to the back side of the bag and conveniently located double pockets toward the front inside of the bag. Pockets are two different sizes. Any size phone will fit! The Zipper has a copyright mark and is trimmed in leather. The top edge of the double pockets are both lined with leather, to keep the integrity of the bag over time. The outside is exquisite! All the Gold Hardware is in pristine condition. Even the under side. What I like most about this bag is its weight. It is light, so you wont feel like the weight is too much after carrying it all day. Bag Numbers located inside the Zipper pocket: 204991/215541 What a fashion blogger says about the bag:I love tiny, sophisticated bags that make a statement. Kind of like Alice Cullen, who is petite and graceful but packs a mean punch (that\u2019s for you, fellow Twilight fans). That is why I was so excited when I saw the Alexander McQueen Clover Medium Satchel. Key word: medium, but my eyes glossed over that and I only saw the stock photograph, imagining how gorgeous the little bag must look in person. Then I clicked on over to the main page and I realized that this is actually quite a large bag. Oh, looks can be so deceiving. Though my hopes for the tiny, tiny bag were dashed, I came around and rather like this bag despite its size. like the brazenness of the patent leather combined with the simple clover design, and I\u2019m a big fan of the huge golden plate in the center. Some may think it obnoxious, but I think it makes the bag a little more alluring, mostly because your eye is just drawn to that bright spot. This McQueen works that plate much better than the Alexander McQueen Clover Hobo that we reviewed in May. Finally, I can\u2019t resist a bag with feet, even if that bag is almost as big as I am.
