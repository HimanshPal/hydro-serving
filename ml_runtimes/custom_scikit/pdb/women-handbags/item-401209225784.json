  "Description": "Designs by Keri\u00ae Want another size just email me! No charge to customize! so many ribbon color choices Add name no charge! PERSONALIZE: EMAIL ME AFTER PURCHASE WITH DETAILS ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Size is aprox: xlg 14\" tall x 19\" wide x 5\" deep with 31\" handles This bag is made with a dark gray with tiny dot fabric that has all the Kawaii avenger characters. I have used a solid black at the top and for the handles and added a red grosgrain ribbon trim and bow. I have many other ribbon trim colors I could use also. Would look great with your child's name added at the top. Best of all it has two outside gathered pockets perfect for a cell phone, baby bottle etc. Choose your closure: Zipper, magnetic snap, Velcro, button and loop, ribbon or a cloth tie. The bag is fully lined and there are 6 interior pockets with embroidered tops, which are perfect for bottles, sunglasses, cellphones, wallets, etc. It has a heavy fleece between the fabrics to make it sturdy and it stands on it's own even when empty. This is a perfect bag for anyone who loves room for everything! Matching accessories available for purchase Choose a make-up bag, wallet, changing pad, pencil case, check book cover or change purse and more, all can be matched to your bag. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Most of my items are made after purchase so I can offer customizing such as handle length, your choice of closures and adding a monogram, initials or full name. I can still add name or initials to a completed bag no problem. So I will always be out just a bit in orders Each and every order is important and I will complete yours as quickly as possible. If you are concerned with time, be sure to email me prior to purchase. Also if you have a rush order for a baby shower etc. Just email me prior to purchase to be sure I can hurry it out for you. My home is smoke free and I really love what I do. Any questions just email me, I am always here to answer your emails and help you design that special bag for any occasion. All my Bags are made one at a time. No two are exactly a like. All dimensions are approx. I pay special attention to detail and I reinforce all stress points.
