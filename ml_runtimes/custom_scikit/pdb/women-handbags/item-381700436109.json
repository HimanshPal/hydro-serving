You are always welcome to ask ANY INFORMATION which you feel is necessary before your purchase, and we will be glad to help out. We do have a simple & clear REFUND POLICY, but it is better to avoid any misunderstanding upfront. Of course, the older an item is, the more likely it will display indications of its age. Signs of wear should be expected. Although condition ranks as a main buying consideration for vintage clothing, it\u2019s not as crucial for older items. Don't buy something that you consider inferior to your expectations just because it has a well known brand name. Ask us to specify any damage or irregularities a garment which may not be specified on the item description, or just something you want to point out or fully understand. And don\u2019t rely solely on a condition term if you are unsure of the quality of a garment. Payment Primary payment method is PayPal.
