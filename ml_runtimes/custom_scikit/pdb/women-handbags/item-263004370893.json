  "Description": "Great not-too-big satchel by PAUL AND JOE SISTER. The bag is made of rich, high quality leather with a wonderfully soft hand to it. In lovely, pre-owned condition. The bag features a top handle and exterior pocket with magnetic closure. The leather flap has both a magnetic closure and two leather tabs that offer additional security. The interior of the bag is very roomy with a center, zippered pocket. There is also a zippered pocket at the back of the bag with 2 open pockets for phone, pens, etc. In addition to the top handle there are brass D rings on either side where a strap handle (not included) can be attached for shoulder or cross body wear. The bottom of the satchel is protected with four, brass feet. Measures approximately 11.5 inches high, 15 inches long, and 4 inches deep. Please note that the bag easily accommodates greater than four inch widths because of it's soft, unstructured body. However, for clarity, the actual leather section the feet are attached to is four inches. Let me know if you have any questions about this final sale item. I hope you'll have a look at my other listings.",
