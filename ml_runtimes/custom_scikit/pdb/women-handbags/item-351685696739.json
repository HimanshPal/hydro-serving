The pockes will be made from a combination of the lining fabric and the cowpokes.The bag, handles and the lining are all interfaced with a heavy interfacing to give the bag body so that it will stand on its on. There is also a plastic canvas placed between the liner and the outside so the bag will not sag when full. 6 double faced pockets sized to hold your sunglasses and cell phone, keys, diapers, wipes, bottles(of any size) and sippy cups and anything else you may need.
