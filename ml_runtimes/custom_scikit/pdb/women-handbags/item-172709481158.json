In response to many ebay customers abusing the return policy by claiming anything to get a return postage free, buyers remorse, etc. I have to change my return policy. I will accept certain return on a case by case basis. Buyers remorse, buying just to get a look at it, etc. will not be accepted for return. If there is something wrong with the bag, not described, if you have discussed with me prior that it may be needed for return ie: a gift, a certain style or size is required will be accepted by me. I apologize to my customers for this inconvenience but some selfish and inconsiderate users have ruined it for everyone.\u00a0 To anyone that has an interest in any of the bags listed on my store, I will be having a huge bag sale",
