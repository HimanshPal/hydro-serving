Two keys are included with the bag. In the main compartment you will find two leather pen holders, a cell phone pocket as well as three business card pockets.

There is also an inside zippered compartment on the back wall of the interior. On the back of the briefcase is an additional compartment with a snap magnetic closure. This briefcase is first grade and is handmade in Germany with the finest quality German leather. It was purchased by me directly from Goldpfeil in Germany. Due to its size, this bag is extremely versatile and can be used as a ladies handbag or as a ladies briefcase. With its unisex style, this briefcase can also be used by men who prefer a smaller briefcase. The case can also be used as a handy airport carry on as it is the perfect size for airline travel for carrying documents, magazines and as well the bag is a perfect size for an 8.5\" x 11\" notepad. Here are the dimensions: Length: 13.5\" (34.5 cm.) Width: 3\" (7.5 cm.)

The selected skins from stable-fattened bulls from southern Germany-considered by many in the leather goods industry to be the best raw hides in the world are tanned for several months in the pit using natural vegetable substances and then aniline-dyed in the barrel. Their brilliant Oxford finish with its distinctive yet subtle two-tone effect is obtained in a manual process and further stresses the fascinating surface of this valuable leather. All of the models of the Oxford collection are tooled by hand and carefully sewn. For more than 155 years, the perfect craftsmanship of Goldpfeil's fine bag and briefcase makers has stood for an immaculate finish and extreme durability in of all their products.
