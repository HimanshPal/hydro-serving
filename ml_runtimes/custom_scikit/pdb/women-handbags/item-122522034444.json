Cult following - also sold at Steven Alan stores. Works for both men and women - subtle luxe minimal detailing designed by Christian Metzner. This one in natural linen with white leather handles and bottom.Lightweight and reversible. Two handles. Perfect for your Hamptons or European getaway.- Measurements: 17.7\u201dx 16.9\u201d x 7.8\u201d.\u2013 Inside, one large main compartment and one card holder \u2013 100%linen, coated with PU on the backside for protection, made in Italy \u2013 strap and handles in cowhide, pure vegetable tanned, made in Belgium \u2013 seams with hard\u2013wearing thread and 3 stitchesMade in Europe. Philipp Bree insists on the use of high quality materials sourced from selected, long-established European manufacturers. Production of the bags is entrusted to the expert craft workers at a family firm of bag-makers in Bohemia, Czech Republic, who have been plying their trade for generations.LEATHEREvery hide is hand-selected and pure vegetable tanned. Philipp Bree sources the hides from one of Europe\u2019s most renowned tanneries. Based in Wallonia, Belgium, the company has been specialising in the vegetable tanning of top quality cowhide since 1873. This material-friendly process retains the natural surface structure of the hide, producing leather that is supple to the touch, with that distinctive aromatic fragrance. Only some ten percent of all leather worldwide is vegetable tanned, which is why natural leather is so highly valued and treasured. \u2028\u2028The bags and accessories are lined with fine suede calfskin, which comes from a specialist workshop in Poland that has been manufacturing fine split leather for over 150 years.LINENThe densely woven, hardy linen is extremely hardwearing and is sourced from an Italian family firm. Back in the 19th century this company was already famous for its sturdy ropes \u2013 ropes that, to this day, still bear many a church bell in Tuscany. \u2028\u2028Linen is one of the oldest natural fibres used in fabric production, but today features in less than one percent of all textiles. The reason is to be found in the demanding nature of linen as a crop. The flax plants flower for just a single day and are then harvested. And little has changed over the centuries in terms of the labour-intensive processing of the fibres.THREADThe selected thread used in PB 0110 bags is exceptionally tear and abrasion-resistant. It is spun in southwest Germany by a specialist family firm dating back more than 150 years. All sales final. Sorry, no returns.
