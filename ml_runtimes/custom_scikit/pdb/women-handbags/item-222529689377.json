Embossed leathers are worked to artificially represent animal skin such as crocodile and or snake. Please use our pictures as references for details. If you are unsure please feel free to ask questions or ask for more pictures before purchasing an item. NOTE: ANY MINOR NATURAL LEATHER IMPERFECTIONS SHOWN IN THE LISTING PICTURES ARE NOT VALID REASONS TO RETURN AS \u201cSIGNIFICANTLY NOT AS DESCRIBED\u201d PICTURES All pictures are taken of the actual item. Please note that sometimes packaging \u201cfluff\u201d might be seen in pictures when they are enlarged. If you are afraid these might be imperfections please contact me and I will be happy to take additional pictures. I include pictures with and without a flash. Please use our pictures as references for color and size details. If you are unsure please feel free to ask questions or for more pictures before purchasing an item. IMPORTANT: This information is being shared with you in an effort to help you make an informed and safe purchase on eBay. My listings will only include pictures that I have personally taken of my actual item for sale. It is unsafe to purchase designer items from listings that only include stock photos which have been copied and pasted from the designer\u2019s website and or the internet. Using \u201cstock\u201d photos is against eBay policy and also against the law. If the seller doesn\u2019t provide any pictures of their actual item for sale you will be purchasing an item \u201csight unseen\u201d You could be purchasing a counterfeit item, a damaged item or an item that the seller doesn\u2019t even have in their possession. Sellers of authentic and undamaged merchandise should be willing to take many photographs of their actual item and include them in their listings. COLOR NOTE: A DIFFERENCE IN SHADE OF COLOR IS NOT A REASON TO RETURN AS \u201cSIGNIFICANTLY NOT AS DESCRIBED\u201d IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A CERTAIN SHADE OF COLOR AND ARE UNSURE PLEASE ASK FOR MORE PHOTOS, IM HAPPY TO SEND THEM! I take photos with and without the flash with the hopes of showing the color in different lighting conditions. Each computer screen varies and may affect the actual color of the item compared to once you actually see it. We include the manufacturers color name and or codes to assist with defining the color. If color is extremely important to you and you have reservations please contact me and request additional photos. I am happy to provide them. MEASUREMENTS THE MEASUREMENTS USED TO DESCRIBE MY ITEMS COME DIRECTLY FROM THE DESIGNERS If you are looking for a specific size bag or have size considerations or are unsure my item will fit your needs, please ask us to provide you with actual measurements. Since the designer designed and manufactured the item we feel they have better knowledge of the items measurements. We have a very large inventory and it is time consuming to measure each and every item. The pictures should help you determine the size, look at the design and follow the designers method of measuring stated below: IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT: The DESIGNERS typically use the LONGEST measurement as the LENGTH. Same goes for HEIGHT and DEBTH THE LENGTH is measured by looking at the front of the item and measuring the longest area across from left to right THE HEIGHT is measured by looking at the front of the handbag and measuring the tallest area from top to bottom THE DEPTH is measured by looking at the side of the handbag and measuring the widest area from left to right NOTE: SIZE OF ITEM IS NOT A VALID REASON TO CLAIM THE ITEM IS \u201cSIGNIFICANTLY NOT AS DESCRIBED\u201d As stated above I provide clear measurements from the designer in my listings and I have explained how designers measure items in my terms of sale. If you are unsure the size will work for you contact me prior to purchasing and request actual measurements. REGARDING NEW VERSUS PRE OWNED ITEMS: Although we mostly carry brand new items but we do occasionally have items that are pre-owned or may have some defect. In those cases, we will photograph and describe to the best of our ability, all defects. It would be impossible to explain every minor imperfection. I do always disclose any obvious significant marks or flaws. Please read all of the description and look at all the photos before deciding if a previous owned item is for you. We make every effort to completely and accurately describe each item but the description is based on my opinion. *Please Note: Previously owned bags generally show some signs of use. We usually do not know their history and cannot tell you if they have been kept in a smoke or pet free environment. We can tell you that while in our possession they are kept in a smoke free and pet free environment. FEEDBACK If you are happy with your purchase please take a moment to leave us 5* Feedback. When we receive feedback it lets us know that you have received the item and that you are happy with your purchase. I sincerely want to give you positive feedback as well and will do so once you have given us feedback on the sale. If you have any concerns please contact us immediately and we will try to work with you. Please do not leave negative feedback based on shipping time. We are not responsible for the time the USPS takes to deliver your item once it leaves our hands. This will ensure our continued success on EBay ABOUT OUR STORE We are not an authorized representative or distributor and have no affiliation with any of the designers or brands that are offered in our listings.
