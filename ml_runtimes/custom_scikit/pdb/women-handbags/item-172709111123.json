Patterns: Wildgrass Dimensions: 33\u201d L x 16\u201d W x 12\u201d H WILDFOWLER OUTFITTER: A Life-long Commitment to Waterfowling\u2028In 1950 a ten-year-old boy became a hunter on a cold, blustery day on Lake Hazel near Benson, Minnesota. Concealment in those days consisted of brown clothing and any natural cover you could find. We built a variety of boat blinds (some actually worked) and always had a bale of marsh grass to cover up with in the boat. In the 1970s, camouflage clothing became readily available and somewhat affordable. In 1998 WILDFOWLER OUTFITTER was founded, building its original Goose Decoy Blind and soon developed a line of lightweight camouflage parka and pants. Soon a Layout Blind was added to the product line, along with a few more patterns in the Cover Up Suit. In the spring of 2003 we moved our production facilities and expanded our manufacturing capabilities. We made improvements to our existing lines, adding additional products, including an exciting line of Waterproof Cover Up Suits. Today, we offer a complete family of Hunting Blinds, Blind Accessories, and Camouflage Clothing. We are known as \"the concealment specialists\" and continue to provide the waterfowl hunter with the best concealment products for the best value. That was the goal when Wildfowler Outfitter began, and it will continue to be our guide as we move into the future.
