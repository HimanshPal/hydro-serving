  "Description": "Thank you for visiting our ebay store! Eco Wish Lanterns From Wishlantern\u00c2\u00ae Wish Lantern continue to be at the forefront of lantern design and in July 2010 we became the first supplier in the USA to sell a 100% biodegradable wish lantern. Back in 2009 we started looking at replacing the small piece of wire in our traditional wish lantern with a fire resistant string that is capable of holding the burning fuel cell. We're proud to announce the arrival of our Eco Wish Lanterns. Constructed with a thin bamboo frame and rice paper to complete the lantern, along with a woollen fire proof fuel cell cover instead of the regular wire cover that our other lanterns have, these lanterns are sure to biodegrade in a very short time after landing. So if you're holding a special event in the near future and want to treat your guests to a beautiful display of white wish lanterns, as well as not being concerned about their impact on the environment, All our Wish Lanterns are individually wrapped and this pack has fifty Eco Wish Lanterns\u00c2\u00ae within it. - Eco Wish Lanterns from Wishlantern\u00c2\u00ae - Pack of Fifty (Individually Wrapped) - Our Eco Wish Lanterns use fireproof string rather than wire - 100% biodegradable - Simply light the fuel cell at the bottom of the lantern, watch it fill with hot air and let it go into the night sky. - Easy to light and launch within a minute or two. Made from high quality, biodegradable rice paper, string and bamboo. - Buy only Genuine Wishlantern\u00c2\u00ae Brand - Sold exclusively by Birando only. Beware of cheap imitations. Eco Wishlantern\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00ae Pack of 50",
