Kenneth Jay Lane - known as the king of fashion jewelry - his stunning pieces made famous by A-listers such as the late great Elizabeth Taylor, Audrey Hepburn, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and Lena Horne. Many pictures included, which I've shot outside to show detail. Don't forget to expand to full screen for best viewing. Description:Get the room buzzing! A jeweled queen bee ornament imbues this leather clutch with a fun, lighthearted energy that's as perfect with evening wear as it is with jeans or a sundress on a warm summer day. From Kenneth Jay Lane.Includes storage bag (not original)Magnetic closure, interior zipper compartment, Kenneth Jay Lane designer mirror in side wall interior pocketMeasures 9-1/2\" x 5\" x 1\"Leather constructionThis bag has two coins magnetically attached to interior (pictured) - so I will assume these came with the bag. In the 50's there was a tradition/superstition - of never giving a purse as a gift without coins in it - so may be something the designer includes. ABOUT THE DESIGNER \"Women of all ages love costume jewelry because it's fun, it's fashionable, and it makes a woman feel younger.\" \u2014 Kenneth Jay LaneKenneth Jay Lane is widely recognized as one of the most innovative fashion jewelry designers. His clientele list reads like a Who's Who in Hollywood and glitters with first ladies, royalty, and movie stars. Born in Detroit, Lane attended the University of Michigan, majoring in architecture. It's still one of his loves, but he confessed he \"couldn't do the math\". He then transferred to the renowned Rhode Island School of Design where he got his bachelor of arts.After graduation, Lane moved to New York, first working on the art staff of Vogue and then as an assistant designer at Delman Shoes. He studied in Paris with the great Roger Vivier and then moved back to New York to head up the Christian Dior shoe division. Lane's breakthrough idea of putting rhinestones on shoes \u2014 deemed silly at the time \u2014 resulted in creating earrings to match for an Arnold Scassi collection. After being featured in The New York Times, Lane began selling earrings in stores on Fifth Avenue within a month. As Elle magazine puts it, \"Kenneth Jay Lane is the hottest costume jewelry designer around.\" His chic designs are always \"just right\" for any occasion.Shipping - Priority Mail.
