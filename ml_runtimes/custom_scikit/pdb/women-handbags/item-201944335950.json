(Items returned through eBay's \"return link\" are not eligible for an exchange but a refund only.) The second purchase should be of equal or greater value. Items returned that are a higher price than the 2nd item (quick exchange) purchased, will incur a restocking fee only for the difference in the price points. RETURNS: An item must be shipped within the return time frame noted on ebay. Upon receipt of the item and confirmation of its condition, we will issue a one time exchange or a purchase price refund minus a 10% restocking fee, based on the buyer's choice. The cost of postage in each direction is the buyer\u2019s responsibility. The restocking fee covers our shipper's time in opening the return, communicating with the buyer, connecting with ebay to complete all the proper forms, reviewing the item, refunding through paypal, rebagging and barcoding the item then transporting it to our warehouse for relisting. If an exchange is requested with the returned item, and the requested item is in stock and is the same style just a different color or size, we will exchange it and offer free domestic postage if the original winning bid was $85 or more. We will send an invoice for the new postage if an exchange is requested for a winning bid of less than $85. EBay does not allow us to hold items. Any exchange completed along with a return, with free domestic postage, is a one time offering and results in a final sale and is not eligible for return. We process returns 5 business days after receipt. When we process your return, we will contact you with the confirmation information and we will cancel the transaction on eBay. Due to time limitations and staff responsibilities, we are only able to message a buyer confirming their item has been received on the day we are processing their return.
