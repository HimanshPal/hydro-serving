Products: All individually hand tooled leaf designed leather handbags and accessories! Production Process: Capturing the likeness of various leaves is a painstaking process done by etching each vein onto a hand stamping tool. Each shape of leaf, flower or stem is an individual tool of impeccable detail! Hundreds are needed to complete just one type of leaf pattern! A whole hide of leather becomes a \u201ccanvas\u201d when each hand stamp tool is strategically hammered into place creating a \u201cpainting of foliage\u201d. This \u201cpainting\u201d is then hand rubbed with numerous coats of dye, bringing forth the depth and beauty of the unique raised texture. The two coats of finish are applied to preserve each work of art! This culminates into a most sophisticated, luxurious, artistic treasure and masterpiece like no other! Statement: Sought after, wanted treasures that impel you to keep adding to your collection! Each is a work of art handcrafted by the artist who has created a one-of-a-kind masterpiece just for YOU! They are so beautiful, you just might want to hang it on the wall! Enjoy your purchase! Returns: If for reason, you need to return your purchase, please let us know immediately! The item must be in the same new condition as when it was sent to you, in the same protective outer covering, with the hang tag! There can be no scents or odors on the material nor can there be stains or spots! No exceptions! Care Instructions: Rather than telling you to buy expensive leather dressing, LL By CL has found that simple petroleum jelly applied monthly or so works best to preserve your purchase! Artist: C. L.
