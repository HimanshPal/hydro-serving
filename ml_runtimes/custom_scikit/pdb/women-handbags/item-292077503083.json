  "Description": "Exceptional piece of LUXURY LUGGAGE - It is amazingly rare to see this piece! It will be a special treat for someone - and a real treat to be seen with!! Authentic, as always - wears its Gucci tagging just inside - and it's COA underneath. Status presence and a wonderful addition to your luxury luggage ensemble! You will not see anyone else with \"your\" luggage, and what a nice feeling! Whether traveling for business or pleasure, you'll love having this piece helping you to travel more effortlessly and, of course stylishly! Looks wonderful sitting in the car seat next to you! Generously sized at 11.5\" x 7 x 6\". All is strong and presents as a handsome, pre-loved with piece. Outside appears wonderfully - just a few rubs in the leather trim. Zips run great and have the Gucci pulls that are bright and shiny. The body of the piece is super sturdy - the GG monogram is done in black and presents super. The leather strap is strong and drops 10\". Inside is spacious - each wall has leather bottle holders. Each end has an elastic pocket. Original mirror in the top. Lined in navy leather...it has peeled in several areas - pictured. Could be removed. Would be wonderful re-lined - but leaving as original, as that's how lots of us prefer! It's been doing duty as a styling prop of late.... hasn't been carried in some time - just stored - ready to be seen out and about with you! Just shows as a nice, vintage, charming bag! Great for a piece which is over 40 years \"young\"! Again, NO ONE WILL HAVE THIS PIECE EXCEPT YOU - and that's a great feeling! It is truly unique - discontinued long ago, so you can't just walk into the Boutique and purchase this piece now. Keep it sitting out when not in service - enjoy it every day! Rare piece to see - don't let it slip buy - and think of all the Vacation and Holiday travel ahead.....fun to arrive with this piece on your arm! Final sale - review photos...more always available! P.S....so many wonderful luxury things currently available...more always on the way! Take a fun browse through the boutique...happy to ship your treasures together! Enjoy! Iconic GUCCI!
