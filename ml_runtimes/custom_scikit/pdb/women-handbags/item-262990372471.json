  "Description": "Brand \u3000 \u3000 Brand: Two Bar West (McFadin) Sizes: Hobo / Tote and Clutch / Wallet Color: Caramel (leather) Hair: Brown & Off-white Made in: USA Approximate Measurements Empty Purse Width: 14\" Depth: 3-1/2\" (at the base of the purse; wider at the top) Height (includes flap but not handles) 11-1/2\" Strap Height (Underneath portion of handle to the top of the purse portion): 8-1/2\" Strap Width: 5/8\" Empty Clutch Width: 9\" Depth: 2\" Height: 4-3/4\" Strap Width: 3/8\" Strap Length: 10\" Condition: I am selling these items on the behalf of my client. As to their exact ages, that is not known. They have been in storage for some time. The leather portion of the purse has many scuff marks, along the side panels, backside and inside. Maybe they can minimized with some cleaning and/or conditioning. As for the hair portion, I do not know what animal it is from, though, I found a similar purse that said theirs was pony hair. I have not been around enough horses or cows in my lifetime to know the difference. I could not find any other information about the hair, not even on the McFadin's website. The label emblem on both items show some wear. Inside the purse, is the main compartment and one open side pocket. The side pocket is black and feels like vinyl. The clutch has the main compartment, but no extra pockets. The strap is removable. The turquoise stones on the front flaps on both items have a snap closure on the back of them. Both have a firm grip when closed. Thank you for stopping by! <>< PAYPAL USA Funds Only Payment is due within 10 days from the end of the auction!
