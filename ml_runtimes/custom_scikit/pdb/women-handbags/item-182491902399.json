  "Description": "Tony Perotti Classic Zip-Around Womens Leather Laptop Bag in Black Tony Perotti Italy Fine Italian Craftsmanship - Luxurious Fashion Design - High Quality Function Since 1970 Tony Perotti has been constantly introducing styles that set future trends while maintaining a firm footing in the noblest Italian traditions of leather craft. All of our Tony Perotti products are made from carefully selected genuine Italian full grain hides, tanned in the most recognized expertise and leather craftsmanship based on ancient and noble Italian artisanship. The cool Italian weather prevents any flea or tick irritation to the animals, attributing to the top quality and purity of the leather without any scratches or bites. The tanning process utilizes an eco-friendly approach by using vegetable extracts without the use of toxic or polluting substances. This vegetable tanning process allows the leather to retain its natural look and feel, as well as beautifying and maturing over time to develop a pleasant patina that gives the wallet an antique look as it gets older. It also allows the leather to be easily manageable and maintained, as the vegetable oils and dye can cover any scratches or marks on the leather by rubbing it off with a fine cloth or leather cleaning lotion. We are certain that you will love and appreciate our products. Thank you for being part of this tradition!
